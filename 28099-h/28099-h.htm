<h2 class="chapter">PREFACE</h2>


<p>These scattered leaves from the unwritten
school-book of the wilderness
have been gathered together for the
children of to-day; both as a slight
contribution to the treasures of aboriginal
folk-lore, and with the special
purpose of adapting them to the demands
of the American school and fireside.
That is to say, we have chosen
from a mass of material the shorter and
simpler stories and parts of stories,
and have not always insisted upon a
literal rendering, but taken such occasional
liberties with the originals as
seemed necessary to fit them to the
exigencies of an unlike tongue and to
the sympathies of an alien race.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we hope and think that
we have been able to preserve in the
main the true spirit and feeling of these
old tales&mdash;tales that have been handed
down by oral tradition alone through
many generations of simple and story-loving
people. The "Creation myths"
and others rich in meaning have been
treated very simply, as their symbolism
is too complicated for very young readers;
and much of the characteristic detail
of the rambling native story-teller
has been omitted. A story that to our
thinking is most effectively told in a
brief ten minutes is by him made to
fill a long evening by dint of minute
and realistic description of every stage
of a journey, each camp made, every
feature of a ceremony performed, and
so on indefinitely. True, the attention
of his unlettered listeners never flags;
but our sophisticated youngsters would
soon weary, we fear, of any such repetition.</p>

<p>There are stories here of different
types, each of which has its prototype
or parallel in the nursery tales of other
nations. The animal fables of the philosophic
red man are almost as terse and
satisfying as those of Aesop, of whom
they put us strongly in mind. A little
further on we meet with brave and
fortunate heroes, and beautiful princesses,
and wicked old witches, and
magical transformations, and all the
other dear, familiar material of fairy
lore, combined with a touch that is
unfamiliar and fascinating.</p>

<p>The "Little Boy Man," the Adam of
the Sioux, has a singular interest for
us in that he is a sort of grown-up child,
or a "Peter Pan" who never really
grows up, and whose Eve-less Eden is
a world where all the animals are his
friends and killing for any purpose is
unknown. Surely the red man's secret
ideal must have been not war, but peace!
The elements, indeed, are shown to be
at war, as in the battle between Heat
and Frost, or that of the mighty Thunder
and the monstrous Deep; but let
it be noted here that these conflicts are
far more poetic and less bloody than
those of Jack the Giant-killer and other
redoubtable heroes of the Anglo-Saxon
nursery.</p>

<p>The animal loves are strange&mdash;perhaps
even repellent; yet our children
have read of a prince who falls in love
with a White Cat; in the story of "The
Runaways" we come upon the old,
old ruse of magic barriers interposed
between pursuer and pursued; and
Andersen's charming fantasy of "The
Woodcutter's Child" who disobeyed her
Guardian Angel has scarcely a more
delicate pathos than the "Ghost
Wife."</p>

<p>There are, to be sure, certain characters
in this forest wonder-world that
are purely and unmistakably Indian;
yet after all Unk-to-mee, the sly one,
whose adventures are endless, may be
set beside quaint "Brer Fox" of Negro
folk-lore, and Chan-o-te-dah is obviously
an Indian brownie or gnome, while
monstrous E-ya and wicked Double-Face
re-incarnate the cannibal giants
of our nursery days. Real children
everywhere have lively imaginations that
feed upon such robust marvels as these;
and in many of us elders, I hope, enough
of the child is left to find pleasure in a
literature so vital, so human in its appeal,
and one that, old as it is, has for the
most part never until now put on the
self-consciousness of type.</p>

<p>The stories are more particularly intended
to be read beside an open fire
to children of five years old and upward,
or in the school-room by the nine, ten,
eleven-year-olds in the corresponding
grades.</p>

showing above the tree-tops,
pointing a white finger here
and there at the clustered teepees of the
Sioux, while opposite their winter camp
on the lake shore a lonely, wooded
island is spread like a black buffalo
robe between the white, snow-covered
ice and the dull gray sky.</p>

<p>All by itself at the further end of the
village stands the teepee of Smoky Day,
the old story-teller, the school-master
of the woods. The paths that lead to
this low brown wigwam are well beaten;
deep, narrow trails, like sheep paths,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
in the hard-frozen snow.</p>

<p>To-night a generous fire of logs gives
both warmth and light inside the teepee,
and the old man is calmly filling his long,
red pipe for the smoke of meditation,
when the voices and foot-steps of several
children are distinctly heard through
the stillness of the winter night.</p>

<p>The door-flap is raised, and the nine-year-old
Tanagela, the Humming-bird,
slips in first, with her roguish black
eyes and her shy smile.</p>

<p>"Grandmother, we have come to hear
a story," she murmurs. "I have brought
you a sun-dried buffalo-tongue, grandmother!"</p>

<p>One by one the little people of the
village follow her, and all seat themselves
on the ground about the central
fire until the circle is well filled. Then
the old man lays down his pipe, clears
his throat once or twice and begins in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
a serious voice:</p>

<p>"These old stories for which you ask
teach us the way of life, my grandchildren.
The Great-Grandfather of
all made us all; therefore we are brothers.</p>

<p>"In many of the stories the people
have a common language, which now the
Great Mystery has taken away from us,
and has put a barrier between us and
them, so that we can no longer converse
together and understand the speech of
the animal people.</p>

<p>"Observe, further, that silence is
greater than speech. This is why we
honor the animals, who are more silent
than man, and we reverence the trees
and rocks, where the Great Mystery
lives undisturbed, in a peace that is
never broken.</p>

<p>"Let no one ask a question until
the story is finished."</p>


<div class="center2">THE BUFFALO AND THE FIELD-MOUSE</div>

<p>Once upon a time, when the Field-Mouse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
was out gathering wild beans
for the winter, his neighbor, the Buffalo,
came down to graze in the meadow.
This the little Mouse did not like, for
he knew that the other would mow
down all the long grass with his prickly
tongue, and there would be no place
in which to hide. He made up his mind
to offer battle like a man.</p>

<p>"Ho, Friend Buffalo, I challenge you
to a fight!" he exclaimed in a small,
squeaking voice.</p>

<p>The Buffalo paid no attention, no
doubt thinking it only a joke. The
Mouse angrily repeated the challenge, and
still his enemy went on quietly grazing.
Then the little Mouse laughed with
contempt as he offered his defiance.
The Buffalo at last looked at him and
replied carelessly:</p>

<p>"You had better keep still, little one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
or I shall come over there and step on
you, and there will be nothing left!"</p>

<p>"You can't do it!" replied the Mouse.</p>

<p>"I tell you to keep still," insisted the
Buffalo, who was getting angry. "If
you speak to me again, I shall certainly
come and put an end to you!"</p>

<p>"I dare you to do it!" said the
Mouse, provoking him.</p>

<p>Thereupon the other rushed upon him.
He trampled the grass clumsily and tore
up the earth with his front hoofs. When
he had ended, he looked for the Mouse,
but he could not see him anywhere.</p>

<p>"I told you I would step on you, and
there would be nothing left!" he muttered.</p>

<p>Just then he felt a scratching inside
his right ear. He shook his head as
hard as he could, and twitched his ears
back and forth. The gnawing went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
deeper and deeper until he was half wild
with the pain. He pawed with his hoofs
and tore up the sod with his horns.
Bellowing madly, he ran as fast as he
could, first straight forward and then
in circles, but at last he stopped and
stood trembling. Then the Mouse jumped
out of his ear, and said:</p>

<p>"Will you own now that I am master?"</p>

<p>"No!" bellowed the Buffalo, and
again he started toward the Mouse, as
if to trample him under his feet. The
little fellow was nowhere to be seen,
but in a minute the Buffalo felt him in
the other ear. Once more he became
wild with pain, and ran here and there
over the prairie, at times leaping high
in the air. At last he fell to the ground
and lay quite still. The Mouse came
out of his ear, and stood proudly upon
his dead body.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>"Eho!" said he, "I have killed the
greatest of all beasts. This will show
to all that I am master!"</p>

<p>Standing upon the body of the dead
Buffalo, he called loudly for a knife with
which to dress his game.</p>

<p>In another part of the meadow, Red
Fox, very hungry, was hunting mice for
his breakfast. He saw one and jumped
upon him with all four feet, but the little
Mouse got away, and he was dreadfully
disappointed.</p>

<p>All at once he thought he heard a
distant call: "Bring a knife! Bring
a knife!"</p>

<p>When the second call came, Red Fox
started in the direction of the sound.
At the first knoll he stopped and listened,
but hearing nothing more, he
was about to go back. Just then he
heard the call plainly, but in a very thin
voice, "Bring a knife!" Red Fox immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
set out again and ran as fast
as he could.</p>

<p>By and by he came upon the huge body
of the Buffalo lying upon the ground.
The little Mouse still stood upon the
body.</p>

<p>"I want you to dress this Buffalo
for me and I will give you some of the
meat," commanded the Mouse.</p>

<p>"Thank you, my friend, I shall be
glad to do this for you," he replied,
politely.</p>

<p>The Fox dressed the Buffalo, while
the Mouse sat upon a mound near by,
looking on and giving his orders. "You
must cut the meat into small pieces,"
he said to the Fox. When the Fox had
finished his work, the Mouse paid him
with a small piece of liver. He swallowed
it quickly and smacked his lips.</p>

<p>"Please, may I have another piece?"
he asked quite humbly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, I gave you a very large piece!
How greedy you are!" exclaimed the
Mouse. "You may have some of the
blood clots," he sneered. So the poor
Fox took the blood clots and even licked
off the grass. He was really very hungry.</p>

<p>"Please may I take home a piece of
the meat?" he begged. "I have six
little folks at home, and there is nothing
for them to eat."</p>

<p>"You can take the four feet of the
Buffalo. That ought to be enough for
all of you!"</p>

<p>"Hi, hi! Thank you, thank you!"
said the Fox. "But, Mouse, I have a
wife also, and we have had bad luck
in hunting. We are almost starved.
Can't you spare me a little more?"</p>

<p>"Why," declared the Mouse, "I have
already overpaid you for the little work
you have done. However, you can take
the head, too!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Thereupon the Fox jumped upon the
Mouse, who gave one faint squeak and
disappeared.</p>

<p><i>If you are proud and selfish you will
lose all in the end.</i></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="upper">gain</span> the story-hour is come,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and the good old wife of the
legend-teller has made her poor
home as warm and pleasant as may be,
in expectation of their guests. She is
proud of her husband's honorable position
as the village teacher, and makes
all the children welcome, as they arrive,
with her shrill-voiced, cheerful greeting:</p>

<p>"Han, han; sit down, sit down; that
is right, that is very right, my grandchild!"</p>

<p>To-night the Humming-bird has come
leading by the hand her small brother,
who stumbles along in his fringed, leathern
leggings and handsomely beaded
moccasins, his chubby, solemn face finished
off with two long, black braids<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
tied with strips of otter-skin. As he is
inclined to be restless and to talk out
of season, she keeps him close beside her.</p>

<p>"It is cold to-night!" he pipes up
suddenly when all is quiet. "Why do
we not listen to these stories in the warm
summer-time, elder sister?"</p>

<p>"Hush, my little brother!" Tanagela
reproves him with a frightened look.
"Have you never heard that if the old
stories are told in summer, the snakes
will creep into our beds?" she whispers
fearfully.</p>

<p>"That is true, my granddaughter,"
assents the old man. "Yet we may tell
a legend of summer days to comfort
the heart of the small brother!"</p>


<div class="center2">THE FROGS AND THE CRANE</div>

<p>In the heart of the woods there lay a
cool, green pond. The shores of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
pond were set with ranks of tall bulrushes
that waved crisply in the wind,
and in the shallow bays there were fleets
of broad water lily leaves. Among the
rushes and reeds and in the quiet water
there dwelt a large tribe of Frogs.</p>

<p>On every warm night of spring, the
voices of the Frogs arose in a cheerful
chorus. Some voices were low and deep&mdash;these
were the oldest and wisest of
the Frogs; at least, they were old enough
to have learned wisdom. Some were
high and shrill, and these were the voices
of the little Frogs who did not like to
be reminded of the days when they
had tails and no legs.</p>

<p>"Kerrump! kerrump! I'm chief of this
pond!" croaked a very large bullfrog,
sitting in the shade of a water lily leaf.</p>

<p>"Kerrump! kerrump! I'm chief of
this pond!" replied a hoarse voice from
the opposite bank.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Kerrump! kerrump! I'm chief of
this pond!" boasted a third old Frog
from the furthest shore of the pond.</p>

<p>Now a long-legged white Crane was
standing near by, well hidden by the
coarse grass that grew at the water's
edge. He was very hungry that evening,
and when he heard the deep voice of
the first Bullfrog he stepped briskly
up to him and made a quick pass under
the broad leaf with his long, cruel bill.
The old Frog gave a frightened croak,
and kicked violently in his efforts to
get away, while over the quiet pond,
splash! splash! went the startled little
Frogs into deep water.</p>

<p>The Crane almost had him, when something
cold and slimy wound itself about
one of his legs. He drew back for a
second, and the Frog got safely away!
But the Crane did not lose his dinner
after all, for about his leg was curled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
a large black water snake, and that made
a fair meal.</p>

<p>Now he rested awhile on one leg, and
listened. The first Frog was silent, but
from the opposite bank the second Frog
croaked boastfully:</p>

<p>"Kerrump! kerrump! I'm chief of
this pond!"</p>

<p>The Crane began to be hungry again.
He went round the pond without making
any noise, and pounced upon the second
Frog, who was sitting up in plain sight,
swelling his chest with pride, for he
really thought now that he was the sole
chief of the pond.</p>

<p>The Crane's head and most of his long
neck disappeared under the water, and
all over the pond the little Frogs went
splash! splash! into the deepest holes
to be out of the way.</p>

<p>Just as he had the Frog by one hind
leg, the Crane saw something that made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
him let go, flap his broad wings and fly
awkwardly away to the furthest shore.
It was a mink, with his slender brown
body and wicked eyes, and he had crept
very close to the Crane, hoping to seize
him at his meal! So the second Frog got
away too; but he was so dreadfully
frightened that he never spoke again.</p>

<p>After a long time the Crane got over
his fright and he became very hungry
once more. The pond had been still
so long that many of the Frogs were
singing their pleasant chorus, and above
them all there boomed the deep voice
of the third and last Bullfrog, saying:</p>

<p>"Kerrump! kerrump! I'm chief of
this pond!"</p>

<p>The Crane stood not far from the
boaster, and he determined to silence
him once for all. The next time he began
to speak, he had barely said "Kerrump!"
when the Crane had him by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
leg. He croaked and struggled in vain,
and in another moment he would have
gone down the Crane's long throat.</p>

<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

</div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>But just then a Fox crept up behind
the Crane and seized <i>him</i>! The Crane
let go the Frog and was carried off
screaming into the woods for the Fox's
supper. So the third Frog got away;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
but he was badly lamed by the Crane's
strong bill, and he never dared to open
his mouth again.</p>

<p><i>It is not a wise thing to boast too
loudly.</i></p>

<p><span class="quotem">"</span><span class="dropcap">N</span><span class="upper">o,</span> elder sister, it is not for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
hunter and a brave to fetch
wood for the lodge fire! That
is woman's task, and it is not right that
you should ask it of me."</p>

<p>"But see, my younger brother, you
are only a small boy and can neither
hunt nor fight; surely, therefore, it is
well for you to help our mother at
home!"</p>

<p>The two children, Wasula and Chatanna,
as they draw near the old story-teller's
wigwam, are carrying on a dispute
that has arisen between them earlier
in the evening, when dry sticks were to
be gathered for cooking the supper,
and Chatanna, aged seven, refused to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
help his sister on the ground that it is
not a warrior's duty to provide wood.
Both appeal to their teacher to settle
the question.</p>

<p>"Hun, hun, hay!" good-naturedly
exclaims the old man. "Truly, there
is much to be said on both sides; but
perhaps you can agree more easily after
you have heard my story."</p>


<div class="center2">THE EAGLE AND THE BEAVER</div>

<p>Out of the quiet blue sky there shot
like an arrow the great War-eagle. Beside
the clear brown stream an old
Beaver-woman was busily chopping
wood. Yet she was not too busy to
catch the whir of descending wings, and
the Eagle reached too late the spot
where she had vanished in the midst of
the shining pool.</p>

<p>He perched sullenly upon a dead tree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
near by and kept his eyes steadily upon
the smooth sheet of water above the
dam.</p>

<p>After a time the water was gently
stirred and a sleek, brown head cautiously
appeared above it.</p>

<p>"What right have you," reproached
the Beaver-woman, "to disturb thus
the mother of a peaceful and hard-working
people?"</p>

<p>"Ugh, I am hungry," the Eagle replied
shortly.</p>

<p>"Then why not do as we do&mdash;let
other folks alone and work for a living?"</p>

<p>"That is all very well for you,"
the Eagle retorted, "but not everybody
can cut down trees with his teeth, or
live upon bark and weeds in a mud-plastered
wigwam. I am a warrior,
not an old woman!"</p>

<p>"It is true that some people are born
trouble-makers," returned the Beaver,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
quietly. "Yet I see no good reason
why you, as well as we, should not be
content with plain fare and willing to
toil for what you want. My work,
moreover, is of use to others besides
myself and family, for with my dam-building
I deepen the stream for the use
of all the dwellers therein, while you
are a terror to all living creatures that
are weaker than yourself. You would
do well to profit by my example."</p>

<p>So saying, she dove down again to the
bottom of the pool.</p>

<p>The Eagle waited patiently for a long
time, but he saw nothing more of her; and
so, in spite of his contempt for the harmless
industry of an old Beaver-woman,
it was he, not she, who was obliged to
go hungry that morning.</p>

<p><i>Pride alone will not fill the stomach.</i></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="upper">here</span> is no greater rudeness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
than to interrupt a story-teller,
even by the slightest movement.
All Sioux children are drilled in this
rule of behavior, as in many others, from
their earliest babyhood, and old Smoky
Day has seldom to complain of any lack
of attention. Even Teona and Waola,
active boys of eleven and twelve, and
already daring hunters, would be ashamed
to draw upon themselves by word or
motion the reproving looks of their
mates. A disturbance so serious as to
deserve the notice of the old teacher
himself would disgrace them all!</p>

<p>"Although we shall hear again of the
animal people," he begins pleasantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
but with due gravity, "and even of
some who are not animals at all, we
must remember that each of these warriors
of whom I shall tell you really
represents a man, and the special weakness
of each should remind us to inquire
of our own weakness. In this life,
it is often the slow one who wins in the
end; and this we shall now see!"</p>


<div class="center2">THE WAR-PARTY</div>

<p>One day the Turtle made ready to
go upon the war-path. His comrades
who wished to go with him were Live
Coals, Ashes, the Bulrush, the Grasshopper,
the Dragonfly and the Pickerel.
All seven warriors went on in good
spirits to the first camp, where a strong
wind arose in the early morning and
blew the Ashes away.</p>

<p>"Iho!" exclaimed the others, "this
one was no warrior!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>The six kept on their way, and the
second day they came to a river. There
Live Coals perished at the crossing.
"S-s-s," he said, and was gone!</p>

<p>"Ah!" declared the five, "it is easy
to see that he could not fight!"</p>

<p>On the further side of the river they
looked back, and saw that the Bulrush
had stayed behind. He stood still and
waved his hand to the others, who
grumbled among themselves, saying:</p>

<p>"He was no true brave, that one!"</p>

<p>The four who were left went on till
they came to a swampy place, and there
the Grasshopper stuck fast. In his
struggles to get out of the bog he pulled
both legs off, and so there were only
three to go upon the war-path!</p>

<p>The Dragonfly mourned for his friend.
He cried bitterly, and finally blew his
nose so hard that his slender neck broke
in two.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah!" declared the other two, "we
are better off without those feeble ones!"</p>

<p>The Pickerel and the Turtle, being
left alone, advanced bravely into the
country of the enemy. At the head of
the lake they were met and quickly
surrounded. The Pickerel escaped by
swimming, but the Turtle, that slow one,
was caught!</p>

<p>They took him to the village, and
there the head men held a council to
decide what should be done with him.</p>

<p>"We will build a fire and roast him
alive in the midst of it," one proposed.</p>

<p>"Hi-i-i!" the Turtle shrilled his war-cry.
"That is the brave death I would
choose! I shall trample the fire, and
scatter live coals among the people!"</p>

<p>"No," declared another, "we will
boil water and throw him into the pot!"</p>

<p>"Hi-i-i!" again cried the Turtle. "I
shall dance in the boiling pot, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
clouds of steam will arise to blind the eyes
of the people!"</p>

<p>The counsellors looked doubtfully at
one another, and at last one said:</p>

<p>"Why not carry him out to the middle
of the lake and drown him?"</p>

<p>Then the Turtle drew in his head and
became silent.</p>

<p>"Alas!" he groaned, "that is the
only death I fear!"</p>

<p>So the people took him in a canoe,
and rowed out to the middle of the lake.
There they dropped him in, and he sank
like a stone!</p>

<p>But the next minute he came up to
the top of the water and again uttered
his war-cry.</p>

<p>"Hi-i-i!" he cried. "Now I am at
home!" And he dived and swam wherever
he would.</p>

<p>This story teaches us that <i>patience
and quick wit are better than speed</i>.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="upper">he</span> boaster is a well-known character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
in every Indian village;
and it is quite plain from the
number of stories warning us against
self-praise, that the wise men of the tribe
have not been slow to discover and point
out this weakness of their people.</p>

<p>The stories told by Smoky Day are
seldom without a moral, and we may
be sure that the children are not sent
to him only to be entertained, but also
to learn and profit by the stored-up
wisdom of the past. Moreover, they are
expected afterward to repeat the tales
in the family circle, and there is much
rivalry among the little folks as to who
shall tell them best. Teona has a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
memory and ready wit, and his versions
are commonly received with approval,
but it happens that little Tanagela, his
cousin, has just won a triumph by her
sprightly way of telling the fourth evening's
tale of the seven warriors. The
little maid listens to-night with burning
cheeks and shining eyes, eager to repeat
her success with the pretty story of</p>


<div class="center2">THE FALCON AND THE DUCK</div>

<p>The wintry winds had already begun to
whistle and the waves to rise when the
Drake and his mate gathered their half-grown
brood together on the shores
of their far northern lake.</p>

<p>"Wife," said he, "it is now time to
take the children southward, to the
Warm Countries which they have never
yet seen!"</p>

<p>Very early the next morning they
set out on their long journey, forming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
a great V against the sky in their flight.
The mother led her flock and the father
brought up the rear, keeping a sharp
lookout for stragglers.</p>

<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="image">
<a name="i43" id="i43"></a><img src="images/i043.jpg" width="374" height="331" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>All day they flew high in the keen
air, over wide prairies and great forests of
northern pine, until toward evening they
saw below them a chain of lakes, glittering
like a string of dark-blue stones.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Swinging round in a half circle, they
dropped lower and lower, ready to alight
and rest upon the smooth surface of the
nearest lake.</p>

<p>Suddenly their leader heard a whizz
sound like that of a bullet as it cuts the
air, and she quickly gave the warning:
"Honk! honk! Danger, danger!" All
descended in dizzy spirals, but as the
great Falcon swooped toward them with
upraised wing, the ducklings scattered
wildly hither and thither. The old
Drake came last, and it was he who
was struck!</p>

<p>"Honk, honk!" cried all the Ducks
in terror, and for a minute the air was
full of soft downy feathers like flakes
of snow. But the force of the blow
was lost upon the well-cushioned body
of the Drake, he soon got over his fright
and went on his way southward with
his family, while the Falcon dropped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
heavily to the water's edge with a broken
wing.</p>

<p>There he stayed and hunted mice
as best he could from day to day, sleeping
at night in a hollow log to be out
of the way of the Fox and the Weasel.
All the wit he had was not too much
whereby to keep himself alive through
the long, hard winter.</p>

<p>Toward spring, however, the Falcon's
wing had healed and he could fly a little,
though feebly. The sun rose higher and
higher in the blue heavens, and the
Ducks began to return to their cool
northern home. Every day a flock or
two flew over the lake; but the Falcon
dared not charge upon the flocks, much
as he wished to do so. He was weak
with hunger, and afraid to trust to the
strength of the broken wing.</p>

<p>One fine day a chattering flock of
Mallards alighted quite near him, cool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>ing
their glossy breasts upon the gentle
rippling wave.</p>

<p>"Here, children," boasted an old
Drake, "is the very spot where your
father was charged upon last autumn
by a cruel Falcon! I can tell you that
it took all my skill and quickness in
dodging to save my life. Best of all,
our fierce enemy dropped to the ground
with a broken wing! Doubtless he is
long since dead of starvation, or else
a Fox or a Mink has made a meal of
the wicked creature!"</p>

<p>By these words the Falcon knew his old
enemy, and his courage returned.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I am still here!" he
exclaimed, and darted like a flash upon
the unsuspecting old Drake, who was
resting and telling of his exploit and
narrow escape with the greatest pride
and satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Honk! honk!" screamed all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Ducks, and they scattered and whirled
upward like the dead leaves in autumn;
but the Falcon with sure aim selected
the old Drake and gave swift chase.
Round and round in dizzy spirals they
swung together, till with a quick spurt
the Falcon struck the shining, outstretched
neck of the other, and snapped
it with one powerful blow of his reunited
wing.</p>

<p><i>Do not exult too soon; nor is it wise to
tell of your brave deeds within the hearing
of your enemy.</i></p>

the Bear, with you to-night! I hope he
will be good and not disturb the other

<p>"Grandfather," says Chatanna, earnestly,
"he will be good. He obeys me,
and is never troublesome like some pets.
He will lie quietly here by me and listen

<p>All the children range themselves
around the brightly burning fire, the
little boys sitting cross-legged, and the
girls sideways, like demure little women.</p>

<p>Although they do not know it yet,
there is a special treat in store for them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
all this evening. The story is one in
which feasting plays a part, and whenever
good things to eat come into a
story, it is a pleasant custom of the
Sioux to offer some delicacy.</p>

<p>The good old wife of the teacher has
prepared a kettle full of her choicest
wild rice, dark in color but of a flavor
to be remembered, and a generous dish
of boiled rice sprinkled with maple-sugar
is passed to each child, (and doubtless
shared with Mato by his loving
friend,) at the close of the story about</p>


<div class="center2">THE RACCOON AND THE BEE-TREE</div>

<p>The Raccoon had been asleep all day
in the snug hollow of a tree. The dusk
was coming on when he awoke, stretched
himself once or twice, and jumping
down from the top of the tall, dead
stump in which he made his home, set
out to look for his supper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>In the midst of the woods there was
a lake, and all along the lake shore
there rang out the alarm cries of the
water people as the Raccoon came nearer
and nearer.</p>

<p>First the Swan gave a scream of warning.
The Crane repeated the cry, and
from the very middle of the lake the
Loon, swimming low, took it up and
echoed it back over the still water.</p>

<p>The Raccoon sped merrily on, and
finding no unwary bird that he could
seize he picked up a few mussel-shells
from the beach, cracked them neatly
and ate the sweet meat.</p>

<p>A little further on, as he was leaping
hither and thither through the long,
tangled meadow grass, he landed with
all four feet on a family of Skunks&mdash;father,
mother and twelve little ones,
who were curled up sound asleep in a
soft bed of broken dry grass.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"Huh!" exclaimed the father Skunk.
"What do you mean by this, eh?"
And he stood looking at him defiantly.</p>

<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<a name="i54" id="i54"></a><img src="images/i054.jpg" width="460" height="348" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>"Oh, excuse me, excuse me," begged
the Raccoon. "I am very sorry. I did
not mean to do it! I was just running
along and I did not see you at all."</p>

<p>"Better be careful where you step next
time," grumbled the Skunk, and the
Raccoon was glad to hurry on.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Running up a tall tree he came upon
two red Squirrels in one nest, but before
he could get his paws upon one of them
they were scolding angrily from the
topmost bough.</p>

<p>"Come down, friends!" called the
Raccoon. "What are you doing up
there? Why, I wouldn't harm you for
anything!"</p>

<p>"Ugh, you can't fool us," chattered
the Squirrels, and the Raccoon went on.</p>

<p>Deep in the woods, at last, he found
a great hollow tree which attracted him
by a peculiar sweet smell. He sniffed
and sniffed, and went round and round
till he saw something trickling down a
narrow crevice. He tasted it and it was
deliciously sweet.</p>

<p>He ran up the tree and down again,
and at last found an opening into which
he could thrust his paw. He brought it
out covered with honey!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Now the Raccoon was happy. He
ate and scooped, and scooped and ate
the golden, trickling honey with both
forepaws till his pretty, pointed face was
daubed all over.</p>

<p>Suddenly he tried to get a paw into
his ear. Something hurt him terribly
just then, and the next minute his sensitive
nose was frightfully stung. He
rubbed his face with both sticky paws.
The sharp stings came thicker and faster,
and he wildly clawed the air. At last
he forgot to hold on to the branch any
longer, and with a screech he tumbled
to the ground.</p>

<p>There he rolled and rolled on the dead
leaves till he was covered with leaves
from head to foot, for they stuck to his
fine, sticky fur, and most of all they covered
his eyes and his striped face. Mad
with fright and pain he dashed through
the forest calling to some one of his own
kind to come to his aid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em;">The moon was now bright, and many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
of the woods people were abroad. A
second Raccoon heard the call and went
to meet it. But when he saw a frightful
object plastered with dry leaves racing
madly toward him he turned and ran
for his life, for he did not know what
this thing might be.</p>

<p>The Raccoon who had been stealing
the honey ran after him as fast as he
could, hoping to overtake and beg the
other to help him get rid of his leaves.</p>

<p>So they ran and they ran out of the
woods on to the shining white beach
around the lake. Here a Fox met them,
but after one look at the queer object
which was chasing the frightened Raccoon
he too turned and ran at his best
speed.</p>

<p>Presently a young Bear came loping out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
of the wood and sat up on his haunches
to see them go by. But when he got a
good look at the Raccoon who was
plastered with dead leaves, he scrambled
up a tree to be out of the way.</p>

<p>By this time the poor Raccoon was so
frantic that he scarcely knew what he
was doing. He ran up the tree after
the Bear and got hold of his tail.</p>

<p>"Woo, woo!" snarled the Bear, and
the Raccoon let go. He was tired out
and dreadfully ashamed. He did now
what he ought to have done at the very
first&mdash;he jumped into the lake and
washed off most of the leaves. Then he
got back to his hollow tree and curled
himself up and licked and licked his
soft fur till he had licked himself clean,
and then he went to sleep.</p>

risk.</i></p>

a full moon overhead, and soon
after supper Tanagela appears
in her snug doeskin gown and warm
robe of the same, tanned with the hair
on, drawing her little brother in a great
turtle-shell over the crusty snow.</p>

<p>Old Smoky Day laughs heartily at
the sight, standing just outside his teepee
door to watch for the coming of the children.
Nor is this all, for in the wake
of this pair comes another dragging a
rude sled made of a buffalo's ribs, well
covered with soft furs, while still another
has borrowed his mother's large
raw-hide for the occasion. After their
frolicsome ride through the brightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
lighted village, they are all in a happy
mood, ready to listen to the interesting
story of</p>


<div class="center2">THE BADGER AND THE BEAR</div>

<p>The Badger lived in a little house
under the hill and it was warm and snug.
Here, too, lived mother Badger and the
little Badgers, and they were fat and
merry, for the gray old Badger was a
famous hunter. Folks said he must have
a magic art in making arrows, since he
never failed to bring in meat enough
and to spare!</p>

<p>One day, father Badger stayed at home
to make new arrows. His wife was busy
slicing and drying the meat left over
from the hunt of the day before, while
the little ones played at hide-and-go-seek
about the lodge.</p>

<p>All at once, a big, clumsy shape darkened
the low doorway. The children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
hid their faces in fear, but father Badger
got up and welcomed the stranger kindly.
He was a large black Bear. His shaggy
skin hung loosely, and his little red eyes
turned hungrily on the strips of good meat
hung up to dry.</p>

<p>"Ho! Be seated, friend!" said the
old Badger. He lighted and passed the
long pipe, while his wife at once broiled
a thick slice of savory venison over the
coals and offered it to their guest in a
wooden basin. The Bear ate like a
starving man, and soon after he had
eaten he shuffled away.</p>

<p>Next day the Bear came again, and
on the day after, and for many days.
At each visit he was invited to eat,
according to the custom, and feasted well
by the Badger, skilful hunter and generous
host.</p>

<p>After many days the Bear came one
morning looking fat and sleek, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
had brought with him his whole family.
Growling savagely, he rudely turned
the Badger family out of their comfortable
lodge, well stored with good
food and soft robes. Even the magic
arrows of father Badger were left behind.
Crying bitterly, the homeless Badgers
went off into the woods to seek
another place of shelter. That night
they slept cold under a great rock, and
the children went supperless to bed,
for the Badger could not hunt without
his arrows.</p>

<p>All the next day and for several days
after he wandered through the forest
looking for game, but found none. One
night, the children were so hungry and
cried so hard, that the poor old father
at last said:</p>

<p>"Well, then, I must beg for you!"</p>

<p>So he crept back to his old home,
where the Bear family now lived and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
grew fat. Standing in the doorway, he
begged quite humbly for a small piece
of meat.</p>

<p>"I would not trouble you," said he,
"but my little folks are starving!"</p>

<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="image">
<a name="i67" id="i67"></a><img src="images/i067.jpg" width="438" height="344" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>However, the Bear got up and turned
him angrily out-of-doors, while the ill-natured
little Bears chuckled and laughed
to see how thin and hungry he looked!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>All laughed but one, and that one
was the smallest and ugliest of the cubs,
who had always been teased and abused
by the others. He was sorry for the poor
Badger, and when no one was looking
he slyly stole a piece of his mother's
meat and threw it into their hut, and
then ran home again.</p>

<p>This happened several times, and now
the family of Badgers were only kept
from starving by the gifts of the kind-hearted
little Bear.</p>

<p>At last came the Avenger, who sprang
from a drop of innocent blood. He is
very tall, strong and beautiful, and is
feared by all wrong-doers. The Bear
saw him coming and began to tremble.
He at once called to the Badger, who
was not far off, and invited him to come
and eat.</p>

<p>But the Avenger came first! Then
the Bear called upon his wife and chil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>dren
to follow him, and took to his heels.
He ran as fast as he could, looking
over his shoulder from time to time,
for he was really terribly frightened.
He never came back any more, and
the Badger family returned and joyfully
possessed their old home.</p>

<p><i>There is no meanness like ingratitude.</i></p>

<h2><a name="EIGHTH_EVENING" id="EIGHTH_EVENING"></a>EIGHTH EVENING</h2>


<p><span class="quotem">"</span><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="upper">h,</span> Teona, I saw you out to-day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
with your new bow and
arrows! I hope you have not
been hasty to display your skill with
the new weapons to the injury of any
harmless creature," says old Smoky Day,
gravely, as the boy hunter arrives quite
out of breath.</p>

<p>"You have been told," he adds, "that
the animals long ago agreed to sacrifice
their lives for ours, when we are in need
of food or of skins for garments, but
that we are forbidden to kill for sport
alone."</p>

<p>"Why, grandfather," the boy admits,
"I followed a gray squirrel from
tree to tree, and shot at him more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
once, but he always dodged the arrow
in time!"</p>

<p>"And were you then hungry? did
you have any use for the little fellow
if you had killed him?" the old man
persists. "There was once a squirrel who
made a treaty of peace with a little boy
like you. I will tell you his story to-night."</p>


<div class="center2">THE GOOD-LUCK TOKEN</div>

<p>There was once an old couple who lived
quite alone with their little grandson in
the midst of a great wood.</p>

<p>They were wretchedly poor, for the
old man was now growing too weak to
hunt, and often came home at night
empty-handed. The old woman dug
roots and gathered berries for food; but
alas! her eyesight was no longer good,
and there were sometimes whole days
when there was nothing in the lodge to eat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>One day the boy became very hungry,
and he said to his grandfather:</p>

<p>"Grandfather, only make me a bow
and some arrows, and I will hunt for us
all!"</p>

<p>The first time he went out into the
forest with his bow and arrows he met
with a Chickadee, who said to him:</p>

<p>"Shoot me! I am willing to give my
life to satisfy your hunger."</p>

<p>The boy shot and took home the tiny
bird, and when he threw it down before
his grandmother it was no longer a Chickadee,
but a fine, fat Partridge, and the
poor old folks were overcome with joy.</p>

<p>"Ah, ah, my grandson!" they cried.
"You are indeed a hunter!"</p>

<p>The next day, when he went out to
hunt, the boy walked a long way without
seeing any game. At last he thought
he heard somebody laughing in the
depths of the forest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>The laughter sounded nearer and nearer
as he walked on. By and by he was sure
he heard some person talking to himself,
and in the end he could actually make
out the words, although he saw no
one.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha," chirrupped the gay voice,
"I am surely the luckiest creature alive!
I leap and flit all day long from bough
to bough. I am quick as a flash, so that
I can easily escape my enemies. In my
free and happy life there is but one thing
I fear, and that is a boy's blunt-headed
arrow!"</p>

<p>When the boy heard this, he advanced
boldly, and his quick eyes made out a
snug wigwam in the hollow of a great
tree. He peeped in, and saw that the
house was warm and well stored with
nuts of all kinds. Its little owner sat
flirting his bushy tail in the corner, upon
a bed of dry leaves; but as soon as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
spied the boy, he ran past him with a
scream of fright and scampered off
among the thick woods.</p>

<p>The boy followed as fast as he could,
and after a long chase he tired out and
overtook the Squirrel, who sat coughing
and grunting upon the bough of a tree
just above his head.</p>

<p>"Boy," he exclaimed, "only spare
my life, and you shall have a charm that
will make you a successful hunter as
long as you live!"</p>

<p>The boy agreed, and the Squirrel took
him back to his own wigwam, where he
filled the little fellow's bag with nuts
from his pile.</p>

<p>"These," said he, "are all lucky nuts,
and if you put one of them in your
pouch when you go out to hunt, you
will surely kill a Bear!"</p>

<p>This the boy did, and to the great joy
of the poor old folks he became a famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
hunter, so that from that time on they
never wanted meat in their lodge.</p>

<p>Do not harm your weaker brothers,
for even a little Squirrel may be the
bearer of good fortune!</p>

Smoky Day, "I shall tell you
of one who is well known in
the wonder-world of our people. He is
a great traveller, seems to know everybody,
and is always good-natured, but
he is also a shameless boaster and plays
many tricks upon those he meets on the
road. No one is so wise and cunning as
Unktomee, the Spider; and yet he likes
to appear as simple and innocent as a
child!</p>

<p>"His adventures are many. Sometimes
he gets the better of the animal
people, and again they may succeed in
outwitting him, so that he is well laughed
at for his trouble! We may all learn from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
these stories of Unktomee and his sly
tricks how to be on our guard against
those deceitful ones who come to us in
the guise of friends."</p>


<div class="center2">UNKTOMEE AND HIS BUNDLE OF SONGS</div>

<p>It was a bright, sunshiny day, and
the flocks of Ducks flying northward had
all stopped to rest beside a little lake,
and were splashing and paddling about
in the cool water. They were happy
and very noisy, but suddenly they ceased
their cries and calls and became quite
silent, for a queer figure was seen coming
toward them along the curve of the
beach. It was the figure of a strange
little old man, bent nearly double under
a huge load of something that looked
like dry grass.</p>

<p>"Quack, quack!" said one of the
boldest of the Ducks, as the old man drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
near with his burden. "What have you
there?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that is only a bundle of old
songs," replied Unktomee with a smile;
for it was that sly one, that maker of
mischief!</p>

<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="image">
<a name="i83" id="i83"></a><img src="images/i083.jpg" width="583" height="320" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>Thereupon the Ducks took courage,
and quacked and fluttered all about him,
crying:</p>

<p>"Sing us an old song, Unktomee!"</p>

<p>Willingly Unktomee threw down his
load upon the lake shore, and with the
utmost good nature began to build a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
little teepee of sticks, thatching it with
the dry grass. In a few minutes it was
done, and he kindly invited the ducks
to enter.</p>

<p>With rustling wings and shining feathers
they crowded into the little teepee
until it could hold no more.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Unktomee was there, too. He stayed
by the door, and began to sing:</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Ishtogmus wachee po!</span><br />
<span class="i2">Tuwa etowan kin</span><br />
<span class="i2">Ishtah ne sha kta!</span><br />
<br />
(Dance with your eyes shut!<br />
Whoever looks shall have red eyes!)"<br />
</div></div>

<p>Every one of the foolish Ducks shut his
eyes tight, and Unktomee, as he sang,
quietly seized one after another by the
neck as they danced in a ring around
the teepee, wrung their necks quickly
and cast them behind them. Not one
had a chance to squawk, so cleverly was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the work done, and there would soon
have been none to listen to the old songs!</p>

<p>But after a little a small Duck slyly
opened his eyes, and saw Unktomee
wringing the necks of his friends.</p>

<p>"Fly! Fly!" he exclaimed in terror.
"He is killing us all!"</p>

<p>So all the Ducks that were left alive
rose up with a mighty rush of wings and
a loud clamor of voices. The grass
teepee fell to pieces, and the lucky ones
flew away; but lying on the ground beside
Unktomee were enough fat Ducks
for a fine feast!</p>

<p>And the little Duck that peeped forever
after had red eyes!</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>The children liked this story very
much, but it was shorter than usual.</p>

<p>"Tell us about the feast!" they cried.
"Tell us about the feast of Unktomee!"
So old Smoky Day began again:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>Now Unktomee wished to make a feast.
The first thing he did was to stand and
cry aloud:</p>

<p>"Chagah aoo po-o-o! (Somebody bring
me a kettle!)"</p>

<p>He called and called for a long time.
At last somebody appeared with the
kettle. It was the Fox, who was carrying
it in his mouth. Unktomee thanked
him carelessly, and after waiting awhile,
the Fox went sadly away again.</p>

<p>Then Unktomee dressed the Ducks
whose necks he had wrung, built a fire,
fetched water and put them on to boil.
But he was tired as well as hungry, and
while his dinner was cooking, he thought
he might as well take a nap. So he lay
down in the warm sand near by, first
telling his Face to be on the watch and
to twitch if any one came, so as to
awaken him.</p>

<p>While Unktomee slept, the Fox re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>turned
with a friend. Unktomee's Face
did not twitch as it had been told to do,
for the Foxes stroked it very gently,
and told it to be quiet. Having done this,
they quietly ate every bit of the rich
meat, and put the bones back into the
pot.</p>

<p>When at last Unktomee yawned and
awoke, he was very hungry indeed. He
looked to see whether his dinner was
ready, and found nothing in the kettle
except bones!</p>

<p>"Ah! the Ducks have boiled too long,"
he said to himself. "The meat will
all be in the bottom of the pot."</p>

<p>When he discovered that the bones
had been picked clean, he was very
angry, and scolded his Face severely
for not awakening him in time.</p>

<p><i>He who deceives others may himself be
caught some day.</i></p>

of the children, as soon
as they are inside the old story-teller's
wigwam on the tenth evening.</p>

<p>"Ah, I thought you would ask for
another!" remarks the old man with
quiet satisfaction. "There are many
stories of his dealings with the animal
people. He loves to go among them and
even to take their shape, that he may
make fools of them the more easily.
This may do very well for a time, but
it is generally not long before he is ready

<div class="center2">UNKTOMEE AND THE ELK</div>

<p>It was midsummer, and the Elk
people were feasting in great numbers
upon the slopes of the mountain. Sleek,
fat and handsome, they browsed hither
and thither off the juicy saplings and rich
grass, drank their fill from the clear
mountain streams, and lay down to rest
at their ease in the green shade through
the heat of the day.</p>

<p>Unktomee, who had been travelling
far and was hungry and foot-sore, looked
upon them with envy.</p>

<p>"Ah," said he to himself, "that is
the life for me! Surely these are the
happiest people on earth, for they have
all things in abundance and are so fleet
of foot that they need fear no danger!"</p>

<p>Accordingly, he hid his bow and quiver
full of arrows in a hollow tree, with all of
his clothing and other weapons, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
he might appear quite naked and harmless
before the timid Elk people. They
saw that he was unarmed, and they
stood still as he approached.</p>

<p>"Here comes Unktomee," said they
doubtfully to one another.</p>

<p>"Ah, brothers!" he pleaded with them,
"you have enough; you are at peace
with the tribes; you overlook the valley
and all its dwellers are below you! None
is so happy as you. Will you not make
me one of you?"</p>

<p>"Friend!" exclaimed their leader,
"you do not know what you ask! To
be sure, it is now midsummer; our
clothing and our weapons are new, there
is food in plenty, and we may seem to be
happy. However, our antlers, our only
weapons, are yet soft, and the Wolf and
the Wild Cat are ready and fearless to attack
us. Our only hope of escape is in
our fleetness, since we are watched all day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
by the cruel eyes of those who live upon
flesh, of whom the most dangerous of all
is Man!"</p>

<p>"I know all this," replied Unktomee.
"Others may have stronger weapons than
you, but I see none with your beauty,
your stately height, your freedom and
ease of life. I beg of you to allow me to
share it!"</p>

<p>"If you can pass the test, we will
admit you," they said at last. "Notice
our eyes&mdash;we must be ever watchful;
our ears&mdash;they are constantly on guard!
Can you smell an enemy even against the
wind? Can you detect his footfall before
he is near?"</p>

<p>Unktomee passed the test and was
finally admitted to the company of the
Elks; in fact, he was made the chief of
them all, for such he wanted to be.</p>

<p>"Now," said they, "we have made
you our leader. You must guide us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
so that we shall be safe from the hunters!"</p>

<p>Proud of his long limbs and of his
stately antlers, he led them all down
the hill, running back now and then to
urge the hindermost ones into line.
When they stopped to rest, he lay down
a little apart from the others, under a
spreading oak.</p>

<p>Suddenly they all sprang up and fled,
for Unktomee had cried out to them:</p>

<p>"Fly! fly! I am struck by an
arrow!"</p>

<p>But when no hunter appeared, they
were provoked, and grumbled among
themselves:</p>

<p>"Unktomee is deceiving us; it was
only a stick that fell from the tree!"</p>

<p>Then they all lay down a second time,
and a second time the Elks were aroused
in vain. They were still more displeased,
and said to one another:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was only an acorn that fell upon
him while he slept!"</p>

<p>A third time they lay down, but this
time the Elks stole away from Unktomee
and left him sleeping, for they had
scented the hunter. When the hunter
came, therefore, he found only the chief
Elk still sleeping, and he let fly an arrow
and wounded him severely.</p>

<p>Unktomee was now in great fear and
pain, and he bitterly regretted that he
had become an Elk, for he had learned
that their life is full of anxiety. The Elks
had taught him that it is well to be
content with our own, for there is no
life that is free from hardship and danger.</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="ELEVENTH_EVENING" id="ELEVENTH_EVENING"></a>ELEVENTH EVENING</h2>


<p><span class="quotem">"</span><span class="dropcap">Y</span><span class="upper">ou</span> are late to-night, my grandchildren,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
grumbles the good old wife of Smoky Day, as
she stands in front of her low doorway,
peering under the folds of her dark
blanket at the little toiling figures slowly
coming nearer, and the many twinkling
lights across the snow.</p>

<p>"My mother gave a feast to-day," murmurs
Tanagela, in her soft voice. "There
were so many people for us to serve&mdash;I
could not come any sooner! But see,
grandmother! I have brought you some
boiled rice and venison," she ends,
proudly bringing out the heavy kettle
from under her skin robe as they enter
the well-smoked lodge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, ah!" exclaims the story-teller,
whose old eyes brighten at the sight of
the good food. "We are to feast to-night,
it seems; therefore I shall tell
you of a feast and what came after."</p>


<div class="center2">THE FESTIVAL OF THE LITTLE PEOPLE</div>

<p>The big voice of the Bumble-Bee was
heard in every nook and corner of the
wood, and from end to end of the deep
valley, for Unktomee, the generous, was
giving a feast, and the Bee was his
herald, the crier of the day.</p>

<p>"Ho, every creeper, every buzzer,
all ye little people who fly without
feathers, come this day to the festival!"
boomed the Bee. "All must prepare to
exhibit their best skill; the Toad, who
can neither fly nor run, his brother the
Bullfrog, with his band of musicians,
and even the Flying-squirrel with the
rest. Tanagela, the Humming-bird, will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
be the judge of beauty, and the Bat
will judge your skilful performance in
the air. That wise medicine-man, the
Serpent, will also be there!"</p>

<p>So Unktomee's herald made the cedar-fringed
gulches and pine-scented hilltops
fairly hum with his call.</p>

<p>It was in July, the Moon of Black
Cherries, and the Little People gathered
in great numbers at the place of the
Singing Waterfall, which had been chosen
for the meeting-place. The happy valley
buzzed with their million voices.</p>

<p>Then Unktomee, the prudent, saw
fit to appoint certain warriors to keep
order at the festival. For many were
present, therefore mishap or injustice
might be.</p>

<p>The Wolf was ordered to watch upon
the surrounding hills, so that no enemy
should come near; and the Owl was appointed
to keep order within the camp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
and especially to see that neither the
Bat, the Night-hawk nor the Swallow
tribe were permitted to disturb the little
insect people.</p>

<p>The day opened well, with a chorus
of praise from the great orchestra&mdash;a
sunrise song, opened by Ta-she-ya-ka,
the Meadow-lark, in which even the
crickets joined, with their slender instruments.</p>

<p>Then came the contest of beauty, in
which the Butterflies, in their gauzy
dresses of every color, won the first prize.
The Bat, however, who was to judge of
feats on the wing, had slyly made a meal
of some of the lesser contestants. The
Owl swooped down upon him to punish
him, and there was great confusion.</p>

<p>Unktomee could do nothing with his
guests. The Toad began to devour the
smaller creepers, the Snake attacked
the Toad, and even the Wolf came down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
from his station on the hills to make a
raid upon the helpless Little People.
Thus began the warfare and preying
among these feeble tribes that has lasted
to this day.</p>

<p><i>It is not wise to put the strong in authority
over the weak.</i></p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="TWELFTH_EVENING" id="TWELFTH_EVENING"></a>TWELFTH EVENING</h2>


<p><span class="quotem">"</span><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="upper">e</span> shall hear to-night of one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
good deed done by Unktomee,"
begins the old teacher,
when all are in their places. "In the old
days, longer ago than any one can remember,
no one was more feared and
dreaded than Eya, the Glutton, the devouring
spirit that went to and fro upon
the earth, able to draw all living creatures
into his hideous, open mouth! His
form was monstrous and terrifying. No
one seemed to know what he feared,
or how he might be overcome. Whole
tribes of people were swallowed up by
him, and there was no help!</p>

<p>"At last came Unktomee, and by his
quick wit and genial ways got the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
better of this enemy of our race. He is
very hard to kill, for he often comes to
life again after he has been left for dead.
Perhaps by Eya is meant the terrible
hunger, or the sickness that runs like
fire from lodge to lodge and sweeps
away whole villages."</p>


<div class="center2">EYA THE DEVOURER</div>

<p>Once upon a time, an old woman who
was gathering wood found a lost babe
deep in the forest, and bringing him to
the camp, gave him to the chief's pretty
daughter. The girl, who was very tender-hearted,
took the child and cared for him
as her own.</p>

<p>She fed him often, but he was never
satisfied and continually cried for more.
When he screamed, his mouth stretched
from ear to ear, and far down his red
throat she seemed to see a great company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
of people struggling in confusion. However,
she told no one, but patiently
tended the strange child and carried
him about with her everywhere.</p>

<p>At dead of night, when all in the
lodge were asleep, the tender-hearted
maiden was aroused by the crying of her
babe. As she bent over him, there
seemed to come from his wide-open
mouth, as if from the depths of the earth,
the far-off voices of many people in
distress.</p>

<p>Then at last she went and awoke the
chief, her father, and said to him:</p>

<p>"Father, come and listen to the voice
of my babe!"</p>

<p>He listened for a moment and exclaimed
in horror:</p>

<p>"My child, this is Eya, he who devours
all things, even whole villages! This
that we hear is the crying of the people
whom he has swallowed. Now he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
taken the form of an innocent babe and
is come to destroy us!</p>

<p>"We must steal away quietly while
he sleeps, and travel fast and far before
morning."</p>

<p>In whispers they aroused the sleeping
people, and all broke camp without
disturbing the child, who once more
slept in the chief's teepee, which they
left still standing.</p>

<p>All night they travelled at their best
pace, and when morning came, they had
come to a wide and deep river. Here
Unktomee, the crafty one, came to meet
them, smiling and rubbing his hands.</p>

<p>When he had learned what caused the
people of a whole village to flee in the
night, he kindly offered to help them
against their powerful enemy. Terrified
though they were, they were even then
unwilling, for they feared lest he might
play some trick upon them; but Unk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>tomee
persisted, and went back upon
their trail to meet the Devourer.</p>

<p>He had not gone far before he saw
Eya hastening after the fleeing ones,
his ugly mouth gaping widely and his
great, unwieldy body supported by a
pair of feeble legs that tottered under
its weight.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, younger
brother?" asked Unktomee, pleasantly.</p>

<p>"How dare you call me younger
brother?" angrily returned the other.
"Do you not know that I was the first
one created upon the solid earth?"</p>

<p>"If that is so, I must be older than
you," replied Unktomee, in his good-natured
way, "for I was created upon
the face of the water, before the dry
land itself! I know whom you seek,
younger brother, and am come out to
help you.</p>

<p>"Those foolish ones whom you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
following are encamped on the river
close at hand, and I will lead you to them
presently. They cannot escape you.
Why not rest a little now, and refresh
yourself with the delicacy that I have
prepared for you? See, these are human
ears, nicely dried for your meal!"</p>

<p>So saying, Unktomee pointed to a
great heap of mussel shells that lay upon
the hill-top. The greedy monster was
deceived, and hastily swallowed the shells,
which caused him such distress that he
was helpless, and was easily dispatched
by the men of the village, who now came
out to kill him. No sooner had they
cut open his enormous body with their
knives, than a large company of people
issued forth upon the plain, and began
dancing and singing songs of praise for
their deliverance.</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="THIRTEENTH_EVENING" id="THIRTEENTH_EVENING"></a>THIRTEENTH EVENING</h2>


<p><span class="quotem">"</span><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="upper">ere</span> you not frightened last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
night, grandfather?" exclaims
Waola, the boldest of
the boys, before the little circle has
fairly settled into quiet. "Thunder in
the Moon of Sore Eyes is not heard so
often! My little sister cried bitterly,
and Uncle says that it is an omen of
misfortune."</p>

<p>"So it would have seemed to me once,
my grandson," replies the old sage, with
his pleasant smile. "But I am an old
man, and I have heard the Thunder-Bird
speak even more loudly, both in
season and out of season, yet no evil
came of it to our people. Truly I think
that the Great Mystery has set bounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
to the terrors of these his warriors, so
that we need not tremble before them
as in the old days, when their laws were
not fully known.</p>

<p>"There is a very old story concerning
these matters, which I will tell you to-night."</p>


<div class="center2">THE WARS OF WA-KEE-YAN AND UNK-TAY-HEE</div>

<p>Wa-kee-yan is the Great Bird of storm
and tempest, who was appointed in the
beginning of things to keep the earth and
also the upper air pure and clean. Although
there is sometimes death and
destruction in his path, yet he is a servant
of the Great Mystery and his work
is good.</p>

<p>Yet he rules only one half the year.
The other half is ruled by Wa-zee-yah,
the Spirit of Cold, and he too purifies
the air and the water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>When Wa-zee-yah, the North Wind,
the Cold-Maker, comes, the animals put
on thicker robes and some even change
their color to be like the white blanket
that he lays over the earth. Then the
waters are imprisoned for a season, and
all things sleep and rest.</p>

<p>Then comes He-yo-kah, the South-Wind,
also called the Fool-Wind, he who
is the herald of the Thunder-Bird and
causes all the trees and the plains to
put on their garments of green.</p>

<p>For ages there had been war between
the Thunder-Bird, the ruler of the upper
air, and the Water Monster, or Unk-tay-hee,
the ruler of the deep. Whenever
a black cloud appeared in the sky
and cast its threatening shadow upon
the water, all the fishes knew it for a
warning to descend to the floor of their
watery abode, the deep, dark realm,
away from the power of his arrows.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Even the sea birds must seek their
sheltered coves and hiding-places, pull
tight their downy blankets and be still,
for now Wa-kee-yan would sweep sea
and air with his mighty wing, and punish
the disobedient.</p>

<p>All was quiet before his approach.
His breath was the tempest, the roll of
the thunder his drum-beat, the lightning's
flash his tomahawk. At his approach,
the face of the deep was thrown
into a mighty commotion. Column after
column of white warriors advanced boldly
upon the land, and broke upon the rocky
shores with a loud war-whoop. Such
was the combat of the Spirits of Air and
Water, at which all living creatures hid
themselves and trembled.</p>

<p>At last the great peace-maker, the
Sun, appeared, holding in his hand the
Rainbow, like a flag of many colors, a
sign that the battle is over. He sent each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
of the warriors to his own place. Gentle
airs came down from above to meet and
play with the little waves that danced
upon the blue water. He who is our
Father, the father of our bodies, whose
wife is our Mother the Earth, wishes
safety and peace for all his children,
therefore he still watches the unruly ones
from the middle of the sky, and their
battles are quickly ended.</p>

<p><span class="quotem">"</span><span class="dropcap">I</span> <span class="upper">shall</span> now tell you of the First<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Man, and how he came upon
earth as an infant, yet without
father or mother. Listen well, my children,
for you should never forget this
story."</p>


<div class="center2">THE LITTLE BOY MAN</div>

<p>At the beginning of things, He-who-was-first-Created
found himself living
alone. The earth was here before him,
clothed in green grass and thick forests,
and peopled with the animal tribes.
Then all these spoke one language, and
the Lonely One was heralded by them
everywhere as he roamed to and fro over
the world, both upon dry land and in the
depths of the sea.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>One day, when he returned to his
teepee from a long wandering, he felt
a pain in his left foot, and lo! a splinter
in the great toe! Drawing out the splinter,
he tossed it upward through the smoke-hole
of the lodge. He could hear it roll
and rattle down over the birch-bark
covering, and in the instant that it
touched the ground, there arose the cry
of a new-born child!</p>

<p>He-who-was-first-Created at once came
forth and took up the infant, who was
the Boy Man, the father of the human
race here upon earth.</p>

<p>Now the little Boy Man grew and flourished,
and was perfectly happy under
the wise guidance of his friend and Elder
Brother. Although he had neither father
nor mother, and only animals for playmates,
it is said that no child born of
human parents has ever led so free and
happy a life as he. In those days, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
was peace between the animals and the
Boy Man. Sometimes they challenged
him to friendly contests, whereupon He-who-was-first-Created
taught his little
brother how to outwit them by clever
tricks and devices. This he was often
able to do; but not always; for sometimes
the animals by their greater
strength finally overcame him.</p>

<p>One morning the Boy Man went out
from his lodge as usual to the day's
occupations, but did not return at night
nor for many nights afterward. He-who-was-first-Created
mourned and wailed
long for the lost one. At last he became
angry, and set out to look for the bones
of his brother.</p>

<p>He travelled from east to west across
the world, but found no trace of the one
he sought, and all of the land creatures
whom he questioned declared that they
had not seen him pass by.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Next he followed the rivers, and the
shores of the Great Lakes, and there
one day he heard an old woman singing
as she cut down a tree at the edge of the
water. The traveller came closer to
hear the words of the song; and lo! it
was a song of the scalp-dance, and in it
she spoke the name of the lost Boy Man.</p>

<p>He-who-was-first-Created now turned
himself into a King-fisher, and so approached
unsuspected and talked with
the old Beaver-woman. From her he
learned that his younger brother had
been enticed into the Great Water and
destroyed by the monster of the deep,
Unk-tay-hee. Thereupon he went down
to the shore and changed himself into
a tall pine overlooking the lake.</p>

<p>For many moons He-who-was-first-Created
remained thus, until at last he
beheld two huge forms rising up in the
midst of the waves. The monsters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
glided gradually toward the shore and
lay basking in the sun at his feet, rocking
gently with the motion of the quiet
water. It was old Unk-tay-hee and his
mate.</p>

<div class="microspace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="image">

</div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>"Husband!" exclaimed the wife of
Unk-tay-hee, "for ages this has been
our resting-place, and yet I have never
seen this tree before!"</p>

<p>"Woman, the tree has always been
there!" returned the water monster.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I am sure it was not here before,"
she insisted.</p>

<p>Then Unk-tay-hee wound his immense
scaly tail about the giant pine and tried
to pull it out by the roots. The water
foamed and boiled with his struggles,
but He-who-was-first-Created stood firm,
and at last the monster gave up the
attempt.</p>

<p>"There," he declared, "I told you
it had always been there!" His wife
appeared satisfied, and presently the
gentle waves rocked them both to sleep.</p>

<p>Then He-who-was-first-Created returned
to his own shape, and with his
long spear he stabbed each of the monsters,
so that with groans of pain they
dove down to their homes at the bottom
of the great lake, and the waters
boiled above them, and the foam was
red with their blood.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">G</span><span class="upper">randfather</span> has scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
taken up his long pipe to-night
before the children begin to
gather, impatient for the end of the story.
Chatanna has been begging his father
to tell him whether the Little Boy Man
was ever found, but he has been obliged
to wait for the old man to go on with his
tale.</p>


<div class="center2">THE RETURN OF THE LITTLE BOY MAN</div>

<p>He-who-was-first-Created now took the
form of a swallow, and flew down from
the high cliffs, skimming over the surface
of the water. Within a sheltered
cove among the pines, the water-birds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
were holding a least. Some were singing,
some dancing, and that great medicine-man,
the Loon, was among them, blowing
his sacred whistle.</p>

<p>The Lonely One in the form of a
swallow dipped down to the water's
edge and addressed the Loon respectfully,
asking for some of the secrets of his
medicine. The Loon was very kind.
He taught him several mystery songs,
and showed him how to treat the sick.</p>

<p>"Now," said the Swallow, "if you
will permit me to take your form for a
short time, I will go down into the deep
and try to cure Unk-tay-hee and his
wife of their dreadful wounds!"</p>

<p>The Loon made no objection, so the
new-made conjurer balanced himself upon
the crest of a wave and gave his loudest
call before he dove down, down into
the blue water! There in the watery
world the people saw him as it were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
sailing down from the sky. His path
led now through a great forest of sea
weeds, now upon the broad plains, and
finally he came into a deep valley of
the under-world, where he found everybody
anxiously waiting for him. He
was met by the old Turtle, who begged
him to make haste, for the chief and his
wife were in great agony.</p>

<p>"Let all the people retire, for I must
be alone in order to work a cure," declared
the supposed medicine-man, as
he entered the teepee of the water monster.</p>

<p>All went away unwillingly&mdash;the Turtle
last of all. He told the others that he
had heard the great conjurer whisper
as his hand touched the door-flap; "Ah,
my poor brother!" Now this door-flap
was made from the skin of the little
Boy Man.</p>

<p>He-who-was-first-Created, when he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
inside the lodge, paid no attention to
the dreadful groans of the monsters, but
at once took down the skin of his brother,
and as he did so, he saw the little Water-snake
spying at him from behind the
doorway. The others, who were suspicious,
had sent him as a scout to see
what the medicine-man was doing.</p>

<p>He called the Snake inside, and compelled
him to tell where he should find
the bones of his brother. Then for a
reward he painted the Snake green, and
declared that as he had served both
sides, he should crawl upon his belly
forever after.</p>

<p>He-who-was-first-Created gathered up
all the bones and took them with him
to dry land. There he immediately built
a fire and heated stones for the first
sweat lodge. He also picked a bunch
of sage-brush, and fetched water in a
large shell.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>Having carefully wrapped the bones
with the dry skin of his brother and
built over them a low shelter of willow
withes, he covered the lodge tightly
with green boughs and then thrust in
his right arm and began to sprinkle
water with the bunch of sage upon the
heated stones.</p>

<p>The steam arose and filled the lodge,
and with the steam there came a faint
sighing sound.</p>

<p>A second time he sprinkled water, and
there were rustlings within as if the dry
bones were gathering themselves together.</p>

<p>When he put in his hand for the third
time he could hear a sound like far-off
singing. Immediately after the Little
Boy Man spoke in his own voice, begging
to be let out of the lodge.</p>

<p><span class="quotem">"</span><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="upper">his</span> is a very long story that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
I am telling you," declares
Smoky Day, "and many evenings
will not see the end of it. There are
some adventures of the Little Boy Man
that must wait for another winter. To-night
I will tell you how it happened
that the old friendship was broken between
man and the animal people."</p>


<div class="center2">THE FIRST BATTLE</div>

<p>Now after some time it came about
that the animals became jealous of the
greater wit of the Boy Man, and as they
feared that he would somehow gain the
mastery over them, they began secretly
to plot against him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>At about the same time the Boy Man
began to question his Elder Brother,
and to ask him:</p>

<p>"Brother, why have all these people
weapons, such as spears upon their heads
and daggers in their mouths, while I am
unarmed and naked?"</p>

<p>Then He-who-was-first-Created replied
sadly:</p>

<p>"My younger brother, the time is
now come to give you weapons and I
am sorry for it. Now at last there is
war in the hearts of the animals and of
man; but they are many and you are
only one, therefore I shall help you!"</p>

<p>Then he gave him a strong bow and
arrows with flint heads, also a spear with
head of stone, and showed him how to
use them.</p>

<p>Afterward he tossed a pebble into the
air, and it came down as a wall of rock,
enclosing their dwelling. He tossed up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
another and another, until they were defended
by high cliffs on every side.
Upon the flat tops of the cliffs he spread
out the new weapons, whose stone heads
were destined to be scattered far and
wide when the battle should be over,
to be sought out and preserved by men
as relics of the beginning of warfare.</p>

<p>The first battle was announced by a
single Buffalo-bull, running at top speed
over the prairie. This messenger assigned
to each his part in the attack.
The Beaver was ordered to dam the
streams, and the Badger to dig trenches
under the defences of the Boy Man, so
that they might flood his dwelling.</p>

<p>The Rabbits, Squirrels and other feeble
folk were to gather food for the warriors,
of whom the principal ones were the
Bear, Wolf, Wildcat and Bison. The
Swallow served as messenger to the birds,
and the swift Trout carried the news to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the finny tribes, for all were to join in
this war.</p>

<p>With the gray dawn came the Wolf's
long howl, the first war-whoop, breaking
the silence and peace of the world.</p>

<p>When the sun rose, dancing for an
instant upon the sharp edge of the sky,
one after another all of the animals
joined in the great war-cry, with bellowings
and screechings of the larger
beasts, the barking of Wolves, the hissing
of Snakes, and the shrill cries of the
feathered ones, of whom the Crane and
the Loon were loudest.</p>

<p>The Boy Man stood erect on the top
of the wall, and saw the warriors coming
from all directions, as far as the eye could
reach. On they came, with a mighty
thunder of hoofs and a trampling of
many feet! Overhead that great war-chief
of the air, the Eagle, commanded
his winged forces, while from below the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
creepers and crawlers began to scale the
lofty defences of the Boy Man. There
he stood alone, and fearlessly let fly
hundreds of sharp arrows, of which every
one found its mark, until the ground
was choked with the fallen.</p>

<p>Presently there descended upon him
great hosts of the smaller winged people,
who also had been provided with sharp
and poisonous weapons. Against these
his Elder Brother had forgotten to warn
him; but now he was told in haste to
strike two flints together and to catch
the spark that should come in the dry
fallen leaves. Soon a great cloud of
smoke and flames arose toward heaven,
not only driving off the little winged
warriors, but forcing the whole body
of the enemy to retreat in confusion,
for they had never seen fire before, and
to this day it is feared by all and used
by man only.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the animals were convinced that
Man is their master. When they sued for
peace, all agreed to give him of their
flesh for food and their skins for clothing,
while he on his side promised never
to kill any wantonly. The Boy Man
further agreed that they might keep
their weapons to use in their own defence.
This was the first treaty made
upon earth.</p>

<p><span class="quotem">"</span><span class="dropcap">G</span><span class="upper">randfather,</span> is not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
night beautiful after the long
storm?" whispers Tanagela
shyly. "The moon always seems to me
like a beautiful woman, for she often
hides her round, shining face with a
blanket of cloud, and sometimes she even
runs away from us altogether, as if she
were tired or displeased. But to-night
she smiles and uncovers her face, so that
all the young men are out, each playing
upon his flute near the home of the loved
one!"</p>

<p>The little maid does not often make so
long a speech, and she too hides her face
as she comes to the end. But Grandfather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
smiles indulgently upon his favorite,
as he answers:</p>

<p>"And did you not know, then, that
she is a woman, my granddaughter?
Truly it is time that I told you of these
things!"</p>


<div class="center2">THE BELOVED OF THE SUN</div>

<p>There was once a man and his wife
and two children who had gone away
from the rest of the tribe and were living
by themselves. One day the man went
out hunting as usual, but evening came
and he did not return. The next day his
wife went to look for him, and neither
did she come back to the lodge.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that the young
brother and sister were left alone, but
they were not unhappy. The boy was a
strong and well-grown lad, and he brought
home abundance of meat, while the
girl cooked his food, tanned the skins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
and made all of their moccasins and
clothing.</p>

<p>They had been living thus for many
moons, when very early one morning,
soon after her brother had left her for
the hunt, the girl's eyes were dazzled
by a sudden flash of light, and at the
same instant a tall and beautiful young
man entered the lodge. She thought
at first that her brother had come back,
so great was the likeness; but he did
not act like him, for his manner was
that of a suitor. He remained for some
time, but left before the brother returned.</p>

<p>Now the young man saw at once
that his sister seemed to be troubled
and embarrassed about something. He
questioned her, and she hung her head
in silence. Three times this happened,
and on the third day she told
him all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"To-morrow," said he, "I will set
out as usual early in the morning, but
I shall not go far. If your visitor comes,
keep him until I return."</p>

<p>Accordingly the next day the brother
went a little way from home and hid
himself in a hollow tree from which he
could watch their dwelling. Soon after
the girl's lover appeared, he returned
to the lodge and at once fell upon the
stranger, for he was very angry.</p>

<p>For some time they wrestled together
in silence, and neither was able to gain
the mastery over the other. Finally,
however, the brother felt that he was
being overcome, and he cried out:</p>

<p>"Sister, help, help!"</p>

<p>The girl did not know what to do, but
she seized her axe and was about to strike
one of the young men when he cried out:</p>

<p>"Take care, sister!"</p>

<p>Then she raised her axe against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
other, but he too exclaimed: "Take
care, sister!"</p>

<p>She became more and more bewildered,
for the two looked so much alike that
it was impossible to tell which one was
really her brother.</p>

<p>At last, however, she made up her
mind to strike at the stranger, but
like a flash of light he eluded her and
spoke:</p>

<p>"My friend, do not try to resist me
any longer! I came not to harm you or
this maiden, but to make her my wife!
Know that I am the Sun, and she shall
be the Moon and rule over the night if
she will come with me!"</p>

<p>"Upon this the maiden yielded and
went with him," said Grandfather; "but
you see that she will not shine every
night, for she was only a mortal maiden
and is soon wearied. You know we call
the Sun our Grandfather and the Moon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Grandmother, and we also believe that
the Stars are their children. Some time
I shall tell you how a Star, too, loved
an earthly maid."</p>

<p><span class="quotem">"</span><span class="dropcap">A</span> <span class="upper">long</span> time ago," says the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
story-teller, "man was nearer
the animal people than he is
to-day; they even spoke the same language
and seemed to understand one
another perfectly. Sometimes he loved
and married among them, but his children
were not so good and noble as the
first man. There was something of the
animal in them.</p>

<p>"There are many stories of this sort,

Tidoona and Tankadoona, the Indoor
One and the Outdoor One, in which the
little boy is half-brother to a Bear cub
and they meet and play together in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
secret. To-night, however, I will tell you
another story."</p>


<div class="center2">WOOD-CHOPPER AND BERRY-PICKER</div>

<p>In the old days, when men and animals
spoke one language, a young man who
had grown tired of living alone set out
to look for a wife. He had not travelled
far when he came to a stream of clear
water which had been dammed to make
a small, round pond. On the shore of the
pond was a neat, dome-shaped lodge, and
just outside the lodge a pretty woman
was busily chopping wood.</p>

<p>The young man stood for some time
watching her from behind a tree. Being
pleased with her looks and especially
with her industry, he presently showed
himself, and the girl, whose name was
Beaver-woman, received him so kindly
that in a short time they had decided
to marry and go to house-keeping.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>When their little boy came, the proud
father wished to take him back and show
him to his own people, but to this his
wife would not consent.</p>

<p>"If you must return," said she, "very
well; but we cannot go with you!"</p>

<p>So the young man, who had a great
longing to see again the faces of his
kinsfolk, left them behind and journeyed
to his father's village. He made them
a short visit, and then hastened back
to his own home.</p>

<p>Alas, there was no home there! The
lodge was destroyed, the dam broken,
the pond itself gone, the singing brook
was only a thin trickle of water, and
his wife and son were nowhere to be
found!</p>

<p>The unhappy young man lay upon
the ground, mourning for his lost wife
and little boy, until a handsome young
woman dressed all in black came out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
of the woods. She supposed that he
must be faint for want of food, so she
brought him sweet roots and berries.
When he had eaten, she kindly combed
his hair and washed his face, and after
he was refreshed, she comforted him
with loving words and caresses, so that
he soon forgot the Beaver-woman and
took her to be his wife.</p>

<p>Together they went to look for a home.
The young man chose a beautiful open
spot overlooking much country, but his
wife, whose name was Berry-Picker,
laughed at him, saying:</p>

<p>"Our people never live in such an
open place as that!"</p>

<p>She chose a sheltered spot at the foot
of the hill, and there they began to hollow
out a comfortable dwelling under the
upturned roots of an old fallen tree.</p>

<p>When Berry-Picker, the Bear wife,
sent her husband out to look for bedding,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
he brought in much dry grass; but the
Bear wife reproved him, saying:</p>

<p>"Why, husband! you expose our
home to the eyes of all!"</p>

<p>All about their lodge were bare spots
where he had pulled the grass, so they
had to find a new place in which to live.</p>

<p>At last the pair were snug and warm
for the winter, and as it was now time
to go to sleep, they did so, and slept
until they were aroused by the barking
of a Dog and the footsteps of a hunter
on the crisp snow.</p>

<p>The Bear wife struck the roof of her
house, and a Partridge flew up out of
the snow with a great whirring of wings.
The Dog followed the Partridge and the
hunter followed the Dog.</p>

<p>When the hunter came for the second
time, she started a Rabbit, which drew
the Dog away, and he drew away the
hunter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>But when he persisted, and came back
for the third time, she left her home and
ran for her life, leaving her husband to
follow as best he could.</p>

<div class="microspace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="image">
<a name="i162" id="i162"></a><img src="images/i162.jpg" width="530" height="400" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<div class="microspace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>He ran on and on, following his wife's
tracks in the deep snow, until he came
to a little hut where lived an old Bear.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, my son?"
inquired the old man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh," he replied, "I am only travelling
for pleasure!"</p>

<p>"Do not try to deceive me," said the
old Bear. "I know well whom you
seek! Berry-Picker passed this way only
yesterday, on her way to rejoin her
people."</p>

<p>"And where do her people live?"
asked the young husband.</p>

<p>"They live not far away, my son; but
be on your guard; they are a deceitful
people and will give you much trouble!"</p>

<p>Thanking the old man, he hurried on,
and soon came to the village of the Bears.
It was a large village, and the people
seemed to have plenty to eat and to be
very merry, for they were singing and
dancing. As the stranger drew near,
every young woman in the great camp
came running to meet him. They all
looked alike, for every one was dressed
in glossy black and all were plump and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
handsome, and they all crowded about
him as if to embrace him, crying:</p>

<p>"Welcome home, my husband!"</p>

<p>Now the young man became very
angry, for he knew that the Bears were
trying to deceive him, and that if he
did not know his own wife, they would
take his life. He took no notice of any
of the young women, but turned his
back on the village and went home to his
own country.</p>

<p>This story is told for a warning to those
who wish to marry among strangers.</p>

Chanotedah?" bursts out
Waola even before the children
are fairly seated. "Uncle told
me to-day when I was hunting to beware
of the Little Man of the Woods,
for if I should meet him I might lose
my way and never smell the camp fire
again! But when I asked where he was
to be found, and how I should know him,
he only laughed at me and went on making
arrows."</p>

<p>"This Chanotedah is indeed a mischievous
fellow," explains the good old
man. "He is no larger than a three-year-old
child, and is covered with hair.
His home is in a hollow tree, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
weapons are the brilliantly colored feathers
of gay birds. He delights in confusing
the lone hunter who is so unlucky as to
come upon him in the depths of the
forest. That you may know why this
little man has a grudge against our race,
I will tell you a story."</p>


<div class="center2">THE SON-IN-LAW</div>

<p>Once upon a time there was a young
girl whose parents had been taken by the
enemy, and who lived alone with her
elder brother in the forest, without kinsfolk
or neighbors. The young man was
a clever hunter who provided more than
enough for their needs, and the sister
kept his lodge in order and his moccasins
well mended, so that for a long time they
lived happily together without other
company.</p>

<p>A day came, however, when the young
man wished to go upon a journey and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
to see something of the world. He therefore
called upon the Little Man of the
Woods, Chanotedah, and begged him to
look after his sister during his absence.
He then took his bow and quiver full of
arrows, and set out to discover strange
countries.</p>

<p>The traveller met with no adventures
until the third day, when he saw several
boys playing outside the entrance to
their dwelling, which appeared to be
merely a cave in the side of a hill.</p>

<p>"Here comes our brother-in-law!"
they cried, and all ran back into the
cave.</p>

<p>The young man was curious to know
what this meant, and he went boldly in.
Opposite the door of the cave there sat a
handsome young woman, while her father
and mother were seated upon either side
of the fire. The old man at once arose
and greeted the stranger.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ho, my son-in-law!" he exclaimed;
whereupon the old wife served him
with food and waited upon him hospitably.</p>

<p>It appeared, however, that the young
woman was kindly disposed toward this
good-looking youth, for she soon contrived
to warn him secretly of her father's
intentions toward him.</p>

<p>"When my father takes you hunting
with him," she said, "you must take
care always to keep behind him. If he
tells you to follow any animal, do not
do so, but shoot it from where you
stand!"</p>

<p>Next day the old man invited his
guest to hunt, and by and by they saw a
white Marten in the wood.</p>

<p>"Chase it, chase it, son-in-law!" exclaimed
the old man, but the youth stood
still and killed the creature with an arrow
from his quiver. Alas, it was no
marten, but one of the boys whom he had
seen playing outside the cave!</p>

<div class="microspace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>The next day a white Magpie flew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
across the path, and the old man again
called on his guest to follow. He stopped
and aimed an arrow instead, which
pierced the second boy to the heart.</p>

<p>"Do not shoot a white Deer when you
see him coming toward you," begged the
girl of her lover on the third morning, for
she wished to save her youngest brother's
life. The young man spared the Deer,
and the last of the boys came home unhurt;
but he himself remembered her
warning and took care to keep behind, so
that the old man had no chance to kill
him.</p>

<p>"Ah, my son-in-law, you have beaten
me! Take my daughter; she is now your
wife," he said to the young man, who
thereupon took his wife home to his own
lodge, and his brother-in-law whose life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
he had spared he took with them to be
husband to his sister.</p>

<p>The Little Man of the Woods had
guarded the girl safely, but meanwhile he
had fallen in love with her and desired to
marry her. Being refused, he went away
angry and hid in a hollow tree, where he
still lives, and all who walk alone in the
forest fear to meet him, for he wishes
nothing so much as to do a mischief to
the descendants of the sister and brother.</p>

<div class="center2">THE COMRADES</div>

<p>Mashtinna, the Rabbit, was a handsome
young man, and, moreover, of a
kind disposition. One day, when he was
hunting, he heard a child crying bitterly,
and made all haste in the direction of the
sound.</p>

<p>On the further side of the wood he
found one tormenting a baby boy with
whips and pinches, laughing heartily
meanwhile and humming a mother's lullaby.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by abusing this
innocent child?" demanded the Rabbit;
but the other showed a smiling face and
replied pleasantly:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>"You do not know what you are talking
about! The child is fretful, and I am
merely trying to quiet him."</p>

<p>Mashtinna was not deceived, for he
had guessed that this was Double-Face,
who delights in teasing the helpless ones.</p>

<p>"Give the boy to me!" he insisted;
so that Double-Face became angry, and
showed the other side of his face, which
was black and scowling.</p>

<p>"The boy is mine," he declared, "and
if you say another word I shall treat you
as I have treated him!"</p>

<p>Upon this, Mashtinna fitted an arrow
to the string, and shot the wicked one
through the heart.</p>

<p>He then took the child on his arm and
followed the trail to a small and poor
teepee. There lived an old man and his
wife, both of them blind and nearly helpless,
for all of their children and grandchildren,
even to the smallest and last,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
had been lured away by wicked Double-Face.</p>

<p>"Ho, grandfather, grandmother! I
have brought you back the child!" exclaimed
the Rabbit, as he stood in the
doorway.</p>

<p>But the poor, blind old people had so
often been deceived by that heartless
Double-Face that they no longer believed
anything; therefore they both cried out:</p>

<p>"Ugh, you liar! we don't believe a
word you say! Get away with you, do!"</p>

<p>Since they refused to take the child,
and it was now almost night, the kind-hearted
young man wrapped the boy in
his own blanket and lay down with him
to sleep. The next morning, when he
awoke, he found to his surprise that the
child had grown up during the night and
was now a handsome young man, so
much like him that they might have been
twin brothers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>"My friend, we are now comrades for
life!" exclaimed the strange youth. "We
shall each go different ways in the world,
doing all the good we can; but if either
is ever in need of help let him call upon
the other and he will come instantly to
his aid!"</p>

<p>The other agreed, and they set out
in opposite directions. Not long after,
the Rabbit heard a loud groaning and
crying as of some person in great pain.
When he reached the spot, he found a
man with his body wedged tightly in the
forks of a tree, which the wind swayed
to and fro. He could not by any means
get away, and was in great misery.</p>

<p>"I will take your place, brother!"
exclaimed the generous young man, upon
which the tree immediately parted, and
the tree-bound was free. Mashtinna
took his place and the tree closed upon
him like a vise and pinched him severely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>The pain was worse than he had supposed,
but he bore it as long as he could
without crying out. Sweat beaded his
forehead and his veins swelled to bursting;
at last he could endure it no longer,
and called loudly upon his comrade to
help him. At once the young man appeared
and struck the tree so that it
parted and Mashtinna was free.</p>

<p>He kept on his journey until he spied
a small wigwam quite by itself on the
edge of a wood. Lifting the door-flap,
he saw no one but an old blind man, who
greeted him thankfully.</p>

<p>"Ho, my grandson! you see me, I am
old and poor. All the day I see no one.
When I wish to drink, this raw-hide
lariat leads me to the stream near by.
When I need dry sticks for my fire, I
follow this other rope and feel my way
among the trees. I have food enough, for
these bags are packed with dried meat for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
my use. But alas, my grandson, I am all
alone here, and I am blind!"</p>

<p>"Take my eyes, grandfather!" at once
exclaimed the kind-hearted young man.
"You shall go where you will, and I will
remain here in your place."</p>

<p>"Ho, ho, my grandson, you are very
good!" replied the old man, and he
gladly took the eyes of the Rabbit and
went out into the world. The youth
stayed behind, and as he was hungry,
he ate of the dried meat in the bags.</p>

<p>This made him very thirsty, so he
took hold of the raw-hide rope and
followed it to the stream; but as he
stooped to the brink, the rope broke
and Mashtinna fell in.</p>

<p>The water was cold and the bank
slippery, but after a hard struggle he
got out again and made his way back to
the teepee, dripping wet and very miserable.
Wishing to make a fire and dry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
his clothes, he seized the other rope and
went to the wood for sticks.</p>

<p>However, when he began to gather the
sticks he lost the rope, and being quite
blind he did nothing but stumble over
fallen logs, and bruise himself against
the trunks of trees, and scratch his face
among the briers and brambles, until
at last he could bear it no longer, and
cried out to his comrade to come to his
aid.</p>

<p>Instantly the youth appeared and gave
him back his eyes, saying at the same
time:</p>

<p>"Friend, be not so rash in future!
It is right to help those who are in
trouble, but one must also consider
whether he himself is able to hold out to
the end."</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="TWENTY-FIRST_EVENING" id="TWENTY-FIRST_EVENING"></a>TWENTY-FIRST EVENING</h2>


<p><span class="quotem">"</span><span class="dropcap">Y</span><span class="upper">ou</span> remember the young man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
who married among the Bear
people," begins Grandfather.
"Now to us the Bear seems at times
almost human; he can stand and even
walk erect; he will cry and groan
very like a man when hurt, and there
are those who say that he laughs. In
the old stories the Bears are a powerful
nation; and there is a young man,
perhaps the same one I told you of before,
who is said to have been living among
them at one time with his wife, Woshpee,
and their little son."</p>


<div class="center2">THE LAUGH-MAKER</div>

<p>The village of the Bears was a large
one, and the people were well-fed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
prosperous. Upon certain days, a herald
went the round of the lodges, announcing
in a loud voice that the time had come to
"go a-laughing." Not a Bear was left
in the village at such times, for every one
went, old and young, sick and well, the
active and the lame. Only the stranger
remained at home, although his wife,
Woshpee, always went with her kinsfolk,
for somehow he did not feel inclined to
"go a-laughing;" and he kept with him
his little son, who was half Bear and half
human.</p>

<p>One day, however, a curiosity seized
him to know what this laughing business
might be. He took his boy and followed
the Bears at a distance, not choosing to
be seen. Their trail led to the shore of
the Great Water, and when he had come as
near as he could without exposing himself,
he climbed a tall pine from whose bushy
top he could observe all that took place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>The gathering of the Bears was on a
deep bay that jutted inland. Its rocky
shores were quite black with them, and
as soon as all had become quiet, an old
Bear advanced to the water's edge and
called in a loud voice:</p>

<p>"E-ha-we-cha-ye-la, e-ha-un-he-pee
lo! (Laugh-maker, we are come to
laugh!)"</p>

<p>When he had called four times, a small
object appeared in the midst of the water
and began to swim toward the shore.
By and by the strange creature sprawled
and clambered out upon a solitary rock
that stood partly above the water.</p>

<p>The Laugh-maker was hairless and
wrinkled like a new-born child; it had the
funniest feet, or hands, or flippers, with
which it tried to walk, but only tumbled
and flopped about. In the water it was
graceful enough, but on dry land so ungainly
and ridiculous that the vast concourse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
of Bears was thrown into fits of
hysterical laughter.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha! Waugh, waugh!" they
roared, lifting their ugly long muzzles and
opening their gaping jaws. Some of
them could no longer hold on to the
boughs of the trees, or the rocks on which
they had perched, and came tumbling
down on the heads of the crowd, adding
much to the fun. Every motion of the
little "Laugh-maker" produced fresh
roars of immoderate laughter.</p>

<p>At last the Bears grew weak and helpless
with laughing. Hundreds of them
sprawled out upon the sand, quite unable
to rise. Then the old man again advanced
and cried out:</p>

<p>"E-ha-we-cha-ye-la, wan-na e-ha un-ta-pe
ktay do! (Laugh-maker, we are
almost dead with laughing!)" Upon
this the little creature swam back into
deep water and disappeared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>Now the stranger was not at all amused
and in fact could see nothing to laugh at.
When all the Bears had got up and dispersed
to their homes he came down from
the tree with his little son, and the child
wished to imitate his great-grandfather
Bear. He went out alone on the sandy
beach and began to call in his piping
voice:</p>

<p>"Laugh-maker, we are come to laugh!"</p>

<p>When he had called four times, the
little creature again showed its smooth
black head above the water.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha! Why don't you laugh,
papa? It is so funny!" the boy cried
out breathlessly.</p>

<p>But his father looked on soberly while
the thing went through all its usual
antics, and the little boy laughed harder
and harder, until at last he rolled and
rolled on the sandy beach, almost dead
with laughter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>"Papa," he gasped, "if you do not
stop this funny thing I shall die!"</p>

<p>Then the father picked up his bow and
strung it. He gave one more look at his
boy, who was gasping for breath; then he
fitted a sharp arrow to the bow and
pierced the little Laugh-maker to the
heart. He went out and took the skin,
and they returned in silence to the camp
of the Bears.</p>

<p>Now the next time that the herald
called upon the Bears to "go a-laughing,"
the skin of the Laugh-maker was almost
dry, but they knew nothing of it. They
went away as usual, and left the young
man alone with his son. But he, knowing
that his wife's kinsfolk would kill him
when they discovered what he had done,
took the skin for a quiver and went
homeward with his child.</p>

<p><span class="quotem">"</span><span class="dropcap">S</span><span class="upper">ome</span> say," remarks Grandfather,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
"that the hero of the story I
am about to tell you is the same
as the kind-hearted young man of whom
you heard not long ago&mdash;Mashtinna, the
Rabbit. You will remember that he was
uncommonly handsome as well as generous.
This time he falls in love, and
there is a wicked old woman in the way;
but you will learn some day that true
love is able to defy and to outwit all its
enemies!"</p>


<div class="center2">THE RUNAWAYS</div>

<p>There was once a young man who had
journeyed a long way from home in
search of adventure. One day he came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
to a strange village on the border of
a great wood, but while yet some distance
from the lodges, he happened to glance
upward. In the boughs of a tree just
above his head he saw a light scaffold,
and on the scaffold a maiden sitting at
her needle-work.</p>

<p>Instead of boldly entering the village,
as he had intended, the youth walked on
a little way, then turned and again passed
under the tree. He did this several
times, and each time he looked up, for
the girl was the prettiest that he had
ever seen.</p>

<p>He did not show himself to the people,
but for several days he lingered on the
borders of the wood, and at last he ventured
to speak with the maiden and to
ask her to be his wife. She did not seem
to be at all unwilling; however, she said
to him:</p>

<p>"You must be very careful, for my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
grandmother does not wish me to marry.
She is a very wicked old woman, and
has thus far succeeded in killing every
one of my suitors."</p>

<p>"In that case, we must run away," the
young man replied. "To-night, when
your grandmother is asleep, pull up some
of the tent-pins and come out. I shall
be waiting for you!"</p>

<p>The girl did as he had said, and that
same night they fled together and by
morning were far from the village.</p>

<p>However, the maiden kept looking over
her shoulder as if fearing pursuit, and at
last her lover said to her:</p>

<p>"Why do you continue to look behind
you? They will not have missed you
until daylight, and it is quite certain now
that no one can overtake us!"</p>

<p>"Ah," she replied, "my grandmother
has powerful magic! She can cover
a whole day's journey at one step,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
and I am convinced that she is upon
our trail."</p>

<p>"In that case, you shall see that I too
know something of magic," returned the
young man. Forthwith he threw down
one of his mittens, and lo! their trail was
changed to the trail of a Buffalo. He
threw down the other mitten, and it became
the carcass of a Buffalo lying at the
end of the trail.</p>

<p>"She will follow thus far and no farther,"
he declared; but the maiden
shook her head, and ceased not from time
to time to glance over her shoulder as
they hastened onward.</p>

<p>In truth it was not long till she perceived
the old woman in the distance,
coming on with great strides and shaking
her cane and her gray head at the runaways.</p>

<p>"Now it is my turn!" the girl exclaimed,
and threw down her comb, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
became a thick forest behind the fleeing
ones, so that the angry old woman was
held back by the dense underbrush.</p>

<p>When she had come out of the forest
at last and was again gaining upon them,
the girl threw her awl over her shoulder
and it became a chain of mountains with
high peaks and sharp precipices, so that
the grandmother was kept back longer
than before. Nevertheless, her magic
was strong, and she still struggled on
after the lovers.</p>

<p>In the meantime, they had come to
the bank of a river both wide and deep,
and here they stood for a while doubting
how they should cross, for there was
neither boat nor ford. However, there
were two Cranes near by, and to these
the young man addressed himself.</p>

<p>"My friends," said he, "I beg of you
to stand on the opposite banks of this
river and stretch your necks across, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
that we may cross in safety! Only do
this, and I will give to each of you a
fine ornament for your breast, and long
fringes on your leggings, so that you will
hereafter be called the handsomest of
birds!"</p>

<div class="microspace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="image">
<a name="i200" id="i200"></a><img src="images/i200.jpg" width="600" height="220" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>The Cranes were willing to oblige, and
they stood thus with their beaks touching
over the stream, so that the lovers
crossed on their long necks in safety.</p>

<p>"Now," exclaimed the young man, "I
must ask of you one more favor! If an
old woman should come down to the river
and seek your help, place your heads
together once more as if to allow her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
to cross, but when she is half way over
you must draw back and let her fall in
mid-stream. Do this, and I promise
you that you shall never be in want!"</p>

<p>In a little while the old woman came
down to the river, quite out of breath,
and more angry than before. As soon
as she noticed the two Cranes, she began
to scold and order them about.</p>

<p>"Come here, you long-necks, you ungainly
creatures, come and help me over
this river!" she cried.</p>

<p>The two Cranes again stood beak to
beak, but when the wicked grandmother
had crossed half way they pulled in their
necks and into the water she went,
screaming out threats and abuse as she
whirled through the air. The current
swept her quickly away and she was
drowned, for there is no magic so strong
that it will prevail against true love.</p>

teacher's pleasant greeting.</p>

<p>"That is because I do not want to

Grandfather," murmurs the little maiden,
with her pretty, upward glance and
bashful smile.</p>

<p>"I have one for you to-night that
ought to please you," he answers thoughtfully.
"You know the shining Star
people in the heavens above us&mdash;you
have gazed upon them and doubtless
dreamed that you were among them.
We believe them to be a higher race
than ours. Listen, then, to my story."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>


<div class="center2">THE GIRL WHO MARRIED THE STAR</div>

<p>There were once two sisters who lived
alone in an uninhabited place. This
was a long time ago, when the tribes
upon earth were few, and the animal
people were friendly to man. The name
of one of the girls was Earth, and the
other was called Water.</p>

<p>All their food was brought to them by
their animal friends. The Bears supplied
them with nuts, berries and wild turnips,
and the Bees brought combs dripping
with honey. They ate no flesh, for that
would be to take life. They dwelt in a
lodge made of birch-bark, and their beds
were mats woven of rushes.</p>

<p>One clear, summer night the girls lay
awake upon their beds, looking up
through the smoke-hole of their wigwam
and telling one another all their thoughts.</p>

<p>"Sister," said the Earth, "I have seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
a handsome young man in my dreams,
and it seemed to me that he came from
up yonder!"</p>

<p>"I too have seen a man in my dreams,"
replied her sister, "and he was a great
brave."</p>

<p>"Do you not think these bright stars
above us are the sky men of whom we
have dreamed?" suggested the Earth.</p>

<p>"If that is true, sister, and it may be
true," said the Water, "I choose that
brightest Star for my husband!"</p>

<p>"And I," declared her sister, "choose for
my husband that little twinkling Star!"</p>

<p>By and by the sisters slept; and when
they awoke, they found themselves in
the sky! The husband of the elder sister
who had chosen the bright star was an
old warrior with a shining name, but the
husband of the younger girl was a fine-looking
young man, who had as yet no
great reputation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>The Star men were kind to their wives,
who lived very happily in their new
home. One day they went out to dig
wild turnips, and the old warrior said to
his wife:</p>

<p>"When you are digging, you must not
hit the ground too hard!"</p>

<p>The younger man also warned his wife,
saying:</p>

<p>"Do not hit the ground too hard!"</p>

<p>However, the Earth forgot, and in her
haste she struck the ground so hard with
the sharp-pointed stick with which she
dug turnips, that the floor of the sky was
broken and she fell through.</p>

<p>Two very old people found the poor
girl lying in the meadow.</p>

<p>They kindly made for her a little wigwam
of pine boughs, and brought ferns for
her bed. The old woman nursed her as
well as she could, but she did nothing but
wail and cry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let me go to him!" she begged.
"I cannot live without my husband!"</p>

<p>Night came, and the stars appeared in
the sky as usual. Only the little twinkling
Star did not appear, for he was
now a widower and had painted his face
quite black.</p>

<p>The poor wife waited for him a long
time, but he did not come, because he
could not. At last she slept, and dreamed
she saw a tiny red Star in the sky that
had not been there before.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said she, "that is Red Star,
my son!"</p>

<p>In the morning she found at her side
a pretty little boy, a Star Boy, who
afterward grew to be a handsome young
man and had many adventures. His
guides by night through the pathless
woods were the Star children of his
mother's sister, his cousins in the sky.</p>

<div class="center2">NORTH WIND AND STAR BOY</div>

<p>In the very old days at the beginning
of things, Star Boy went about the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
as a champion, defending all feeble folk
against the attacks of their enemies.</p>

<p>The champion was so strong that he
could not bend his bow of wood without
breaking it, therefore he armed himself
with a bone bow, a bone knife and a
stone war-club.</p>

<p>One day, he came to the village of the
Frogs, who poured out of their lodges to
meet him and set before him food, but no
water. "He who goes to the water,"
said they, "never returns. A great warrior
lies there who has swallowed many of
us alive, and now we are perishing of
thirst!"</p>

<p>Star Boy himself was so thirsty that
after he had eaten, he went down to the
water, and was instantly swallowed by
Tamahay, the Pickerel. But with his
bone knife he slashed the Pickerel in the
gills and escaped; after which he warned
the big fish, saying: "Be careful how you wantonly destroy
this people, for some day they will be
used to destroy you!"</p>

<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p style="margin-top: 1.5em;">He then went on his way, as far as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
another village of Little People, who complained
that they had no fire-wood.</p>

<p>"We dare not go to the wood any
more," they said, "for there a fierce
warrior lives who swoops down from
above and devours us!"</p>

<p>Star Boy at once went to the wood,
where he was attacked by Hinhan, the Owl.
Him he easily conquered with his stone
war-club. "Because of your cruelty,"
he said to the Owl, "the sun shall blind
you hereafter, so that you can hunt only
in the dark, when the Mouse people are
advised to take to their holes and hiding-places."</p>

<p>Now Star Boy travelled northward,
until he had reached the very northernmost
country, and in that far land he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
found a people in great distress. That
was because they feared Wazeya, the
North Wind, who drove away the buffalo
herds so that they had no meat. "And
when he points his finger at one of us,"
said they, "that man dies!"</p>

<p>"Come, let us hunt the buffalo!"
said Star Boy to them; and although
they were starving, they were afraid
and unwilling to go. However, he made
some of the men go out with him, and
upon the open plain they met with North
Wind, who at once challenged the champion
to do battle. The two rushed upon
one another with great fury, and in the
first onset Star Boy broke the bow of
North Wind; but in the second, Star
Boy was overthrown and lay as one dead.</p>

<p>However, after a time he got up again,
and they met for the third bout, when lo!
neither could prevail against the other,
so that in the midst of the fight they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
obliged to sit upon a snowbank to rest.
Star Boy sat upon his calf-skin and
fanned himself with an eagle-wing, and
immediately the snow began to melt
and the North Wind was forced to retreat.
Before he went away, he made a
treaty of peace with Star Boy, promising
to come to earth for half the year only,
and to give timely warning of his approach,
so that the people might prepare
for his coming and lay up food against the
day of scarcity. By this means the winter
and summer were established among us.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="upper">he</span> strong sun of March still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
hovers over the deep blue lake,
and last night's snow flurry has
quite vanished from the pleasant, brown
face of our Grandmother Earth, when
the children arrive at Smoky Day's wide-open
doorway. There is a tang in the
air and a stir in the blood to-night that
moves the old man to tell a tale of youth
and adventure. And this is the tale:</p>


<div class="center2">THE TEN VIRGINS</div>

<p>There were once two brothers who
loved one maiden, and it appeared that
the younger brother was the favorite.
One day, the jealous elder invited his
brother to go hunting with him upon an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
island in the great lake, a day's journey
in canoes from their village.</p>

<p>No sooner had they touched shore than
the elder said:</p>

<p>"Do you go to the other end of the
island, and I will drive the Deer toward
you!"</p>

<p>The other obeyed; but although he
waited a long time on the further side,
no Deer appeared, nor did he see anything
of his brother. At last he returned through
the woods to the spot where they had
landed; and behold! the canoe with his
brother was almost out of sight on the
blue waters of the lake.</p>

<p>The young man, thus abandoned, wandered
about the island for many days,
living upon the game which he found there
in abundance. He had grown very lonely
and tired of his solitary life, when one day
a strange old man with long, white hair
appeared on the shore.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>"My son," said he, "you look unhappy!
Tell me if there is anything you
wish for."</p>

<p>"I want nothing except to cross the
water to the mainland," replied the
young man, "but I have no boat nor the
means of making one."</p>

<p>"Get upon my back, and I will take
you over in safety," returned the patriarch.
Accordingly he took him upon his back
and swam across the lake with his burden.</p>

<p>Now the young man was grateful to
his rescuer and he no longer cared to
return to his own people and to the
brother who had betrayed him, therefore
he went with the old man to his wigwam
to hunt for him.</p>

<p>One day, when he was out hunting as
usual, he thought he heard the far-off,
musical sound of girls' laughter from the
depths of the forest. He turned in the
direction of the sound and soon came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
upon a broad trail, which he followed until
he was overtaken by nine young men,
all running eagerly along the same trail.</p>

<p>They at once made him join their company,
saying that they had needed just
one more to complete their number. The
ten hastened on, and presently they overtook
ten beautiful young damsels. Night
fell, and they all went into camp together
on the shore of the great lake.</p>

<p>The girls were very friendly and chatted
pleasantly with the young men during
the evening, until each party retired to
sleep under a hurriedly made arbor of
green boughs.</p>

<p>Very early in the morning the youths
awoke; but lo! their companions had
vanished, and they could see only the
flash of a distant paddle where lake met
sky at the far-off horizon line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 2.5em;">There was no boat, and they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
about to go back in despair, when the young man who had last joined the party
spied a little mussel shell at the edge of
the water, and invited them to step in.
At first they were doubtful and hung
back; but in the end one ventured and
stepped into the shell, which bore up his
weight. Then another and another followed,
until the ten men stood upon the
shell, which had become a fine large
canoe, and carried them all in safety to
the opposite shore.</p>

<p>There they beheld the great white
wigwam in which dwelt the ten virgins
with their grandmother, who was a
wicked old witch.</p>

<p>As soon as she saw the young men she
took up handfuls of ashes to throw into
their faces, and one after another fell
senseless at her feet.</p>

<p>Last of all came the fortunate younger
brother. He had borrowed the weapons
of the old man with whom he lived, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
it chanced that this man was a greater
wonder-worker even than the witch.
Therefore he had merely turned toward
her his magic shield to keep off the
shower of ashes, when the old woman
lost all her power to hurt, and at once
each lusty young man sprang quickly
up to claim his bride.</p>

the Indians love children's company,
and none is more sorry
than Smoky Day when the village breaks
up for the spring hunt, and story-telling
is over for the season.</p>

<p>"I hope," he says kindly, "that you
have listened so well to these tales of
our people, and repeated them so often
that you will never forget them!"</p>

<p>"We have, grandfather, we have!"
they reply in chorus.</p>

<p>"We must not only remember and
repeat," he continues, "but we must consider
and follow their teachings, for it
is so that these legends that have come
down to us from the old time are kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
alive by each new generation. There
is much to learn from the story of one who
was so modest that he took the form of a
ragged and homeless little boy, and did
his good deeds in secret."</p>


<div class="center2">THE MAGIC ARROWS</div>

<p>There was once a young man who
wanted to go on a journey. His mother
provided him with sacks of dried meat
and pairs of moccasins, but his father
said to him:</p>

<p>"Here, my son, are four magic arrows.
When you are in need, shoot one of them!"</p>

<p>The young man went forth alone, and
hunted in the forest for many days.
Usually he was successful, but a day
came when he was hungry and could not
find meat. Then he sent forth one of the
magic arrows, and at the end of the day
there lay a fat Bear with the arrow in
his side. The hunter cut out the tongue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
for his meal, and of the body of the Bear
he made a thank-offering to the Great
Mystery.</p>

<div class="microspace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="image">
<a name="i235" id="i235"></a><img src="images/i235.jpg" width="550" height="466" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>Again he was in need, and again in the
morning he shot a magic arrow, and at
nightfall beside his camp-fire he found
an Elk lying with the arrow in his heart.
Once more he ate the tongue and offered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
up the body as a sacrifice. The third time
he killed a Moose with his arrow, and the
fourth time a Buffalo.</p>

<p>After the fourth arrow had been spent,
the young man came one day out of the
forest, and before him there lay a great
circular village of skin lodges. At one
side, and some little way from the rest of
the people, he noticed a small and poor
tent where an old couple lived all alone.
At the edge of the wood he took off his
clothes and hid them in a hollow tree.
Then, touching the top of his head with
his staff, he turned himself into a little
ragged boy and went toward the poor tent.</p>

<p>The old woman saw him coming, and
said to her old man: "Old man, let us
keep this little boy for our own! He
seems to be a fine, bright-eyed little fellow,
and we are all alone."</p>

<p>"What are you thinking of, old
woman?" grumbled the old man. "We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
can hardly keep ourselves, and yet you
talk of taking in a ragged little scamp
from nobody knows where!"</p>

<p>In the meantime the boy had come
quite near, and the old wife beckoned to
him to enter the lodge.</p>

<p>"Sit down, my grandson, sit down!"
she said, kindly; and, in spite of the old
man's black looks, she handed him a
small dish of parched corn, which was
all the food they had.</p>

<p>The boy ate and stayed on. By and
by he said to the old woman: "Grandmother,
I should like to have grandfather
make me some arrows!"</p>

<p>"You hear, my old man?" said she.
"It will be very well for you to make
some little arrows for the boy."</p>

<p>"And why should I make arrows for a
strange little ragged boy?" grumbled the
old man.</p>

<p>However, he made two or three, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
the boy went hunting. In a short time
he returned with several small birds. The
old woman took them and pulled off the
feathers, thanking him and praising him
as she did so. She quickly made the little
birds into soup, of which the old man ate
gladly, and with the soft feathers she
stuffed a small pillow.</p>

<p>"You have done well, my grandson!"
he said; for they were really very poor.</p>

<p>Not long after, the boy said to his
adopted grandmother: "Grandmother,
when you see me at the edge of the wood
yonder, you must call out: 'A Bear!
there goes a Bear!'"</p>

<p>This she did, and the boy again sent
forth one of the magic arrows, which he
had taken from the body of his game and
kept by him. No sooner had he shot,
than he saw the same Bear that he had
offered up, lying before him with the
arrow in his side!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>Now there was great rejoicing in the
lodge of the poor old couple. While they
were out skinning the Bear and cutting
the meat in thin strips to dry, the boy
sat alone in the lodge. In the pot on
the fire was the Bear's tongue, which he
wanted for himself.</p>

<p>All at once a young girl stood in the
doorway. She drew her robe modestly
before her face as she said in a low voice:</p>

<p>"I come to borrow the mortar of your
grandmother!"</p>

<p>The boy gave her the mortar, and also
a piece of the tongue which he had
cooked, and she went away.</p>

<p>When all of the Bear meat was gone, the
boy sent forth a second arrow and killed
an Elk, and with the third and fourth
he shot the Moose and the Buffalo as
before, each time recovering his arrow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<div class="microspace">&nbsp;</div>

</div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>Soon after, he heard that the people of
the large village were in trouble. A great
Red Eagle, it was said, flew over the village
every day at dawn, and the people
believed that it was a bird of evil omen,
for they no longer had any success in hunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>ing.
None of their braves had been able
to shoot the Eagle, and the chief had offered
his only daughter in marriage to the
man who should kill it.</p>

<p>When the boy heard this, he went out
early the next morning and lay in wait
for the Red Eagle. At the touch of his
magic arrow, it fell at his feet, and the
boy pulled out his arrow and went home
without speaking to any one.</p>

<p>But the thankful people followed him
to the poor little lodge, and when they
had found him, they brought the chief's
beautiful daughter to be his wife. Lo,
she was the girl who had come to borrow
his grandmother's mortar!</p>

<p>Then he went back to the hollow tree
where his clothes were hidden, and came
back a handsome young man, richly
dressed for his wedding.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="upper">n</span> this last evening, the children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
are told to be especially
quiet, and to listen reverently
and earnestly, "for these are the
greater things of which I am about to
tell you," says their old teacher.</p>

<p>"You have heard that the Great
Mystery is everywhere. He is in the
earth and the water, heat and cold, rocks
and trees, sun and sky; and He is also
in us. When the spirit departs, that too
is a mystery, and therefore we do not
speak aloud the name of the dead. There
are wonders all about us, and within, but
if we are quiet and obedient to the voice of
the spirit, sometime we may understand
these mysteries!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>It is thus the old sage concludes his
lessons, and over all the circle there is a
hush of loving reverence.</p>


<div class="center2">THE GHOST WIFE</div>

<p>There was once a young man who
loved to be alone, and who often stayed
away from the camp for days at a time,
when it was said that Wolves, Bears and
other wild creatures joined him in his
rovings.</p>

<p>He was once seen with several Deer
about him, petting and handling them;
but when the Deer discovered the presence
of a stranger, they snorted with fear and
quickly vanished. It was supposed that
he had learned their language. All the
birds answered his call, and even those
fairy-like creatures of the air, the butterflies,
would come to him freely and
alight upon his body.</p>

<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p style="margin-top: 3.5em;">One day, as he was lying in the meadow among the wild flowers, completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
covered with butterflies of the most
brilliant hues, as if it were a gorgeous
cloak that he was wearing, there suddenly
appeared before him a beautiful
young girl.</p>

<p>The youth was startled, for he knew her
face. He had seen her often; it was the
chiefs daughter, the prettiest maiden in
the village, who had died ten days before!</p>

<p>The truth was that she had loved this
young man in secret, but he had given no
thought to her, for he cared only for the
wild creatures and had no mind for
human ways. Now, as she stood silently
before him with downcast eyes, he looked
upon her pure face and graceful form,
and there awoke in his heart the love
that he had never felt before.</p>

<p>"But she is a spirit now!" he said to
himself sorrowfully, and dared not speak
to her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>However, she smiled archly upon him,
in his strange and beautiful garment,
for she read his thoughts. Toward sunset,
the butterflies flew away, and with
them the ghost maiden departed.</p>

<p>After this the young man was absent
more than ever, and no one knew that
the spirit of the maiden came to him in
the deep woods. He built for her a lodge
of pine boughs, and there she would
come to cook his venison and to mend his
moccasins, and sit with him beside his
lonely camp-fire.</p>

<p>But at last he was not content with
this and begged her to go with him to the
village, for his mother and kinsfolk would
not allow him to remain always away
from them.</p>

<p>"Ah, my spirit wife," he begged, "can
you not return with me to my people, so
that I may have a home in their sight?"</p>

<p>"It may be so," she replied thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>fully,
"if you will carefully observe my
conditions. First, we must pitch our
tent a little apart from the rest of the
people. Second, you must patiently
bear with my absences and the strangeness
of my behavior, for I can only visit
them and they me in the night time.
Third, you must never raise your voice
in our teepee, and above all, let me never
hear you speak roughly to a child in my
presence!"</p>

<p>"All these I will observe faithfully,"
replied the young husband.</p>

<p>Now it happened that after a longer
absence than usual, he was seen to come
home with a wife. They pitched their tent
some way from the village, and the people
saw at a distance the figure of a graceful
young woman moving about the solitary
white teepee. But whenever any of his
relatives approached to congratulate him
and to bid her welcome, she would take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
up her axe and go forth into the forest as
if to cut wood for her fire, or with her
bucket for water.</p>

<p>At night, however, they came to see
the young couple and found her at home,
but it appeared very strange that she did
not speak to any of them, not even by
signs, though she smiled so graciously
and sweetly that they all loved her.
Her husband explained that the girl was
of another race who have these strange
ways, and by and by the people became
used to them, and even ceased to wonder
why they could never find her at home in
the day time.</p>

<p>So they lived happily together, and in
due time children came to them; first
a boy, and a little girl afterward. But
one night the father came home tired and
hungry from the hunt, and the little one
cried loudly and would not be quieted.
Then for the first time he forgot his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
promise and spoke angrily to the mother
and child.</p>

<p>Instantly the fire went out and the
tent was dark.</p>

<p>When he had kindled the fire again,
he saw that he was alone, nor did tears
and searchings avail to find his wife and
children. Alas, they were gone from him
forever!</p>
